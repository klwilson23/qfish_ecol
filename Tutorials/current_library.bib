abstract = {Drawing upon both Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and Western science (WS) enhances equity and effectiveness, while also strengthening the evidence-base for wildlife management, decision-making, and conservation action. However, implementing this approach remains challenging. We systematically reviewed the published literature that reported empirical results on bridging IKS and WS in decision-making processes and the implementation of practices designed to influence interactions between people, wildlife, and habitats. The aim was to examine the relationship between wildlife management, co-management, and knowledge bridging in Canada. Our standardized search across bibliographic databases identified 21 articles, including 27 case studies for analysis. In addition to bibliographic and contextual information (e.g., location), we coded for 11 functional questions across categories: (1) decision-making; (2) implementation of practices; (3) achievement of impacts; and (4) enablers and barriers to success. Through our analysis, we make the case that effective knowledge bridging requires active participation of Indigenous Peoples throughout the wildlife management process, including setting objectives, selecting/designing, and implementing actions, followed by monitoring and evaluating performance. Our findings highlight essential enablers (e.g., cross-cultural competency, trust and relationship building, knowledge co-production) that need to be fostered alongside the barriers to overcome (e.g., epistemological/ontological divides, poor power sharing arrangements, communication difficulties) for equitable and effective mobilization of knowledge bridging in wildlife management.},

abstract = {The wider effects of fishing on marine ecosystems have become the focus of growing concern among scientists, fisheries managers and the fishing industry. The present review examines the role of habitat structure and habitat heterogeneity in marine ecosystems, and the effects of fishing (i.e. trawling and dredging) on these two components of habitat complexity. Three examples from New Zealand and Australia are considered, where available evidence suggests that fishing has been associated with the degradation or loss of habitat structure through the removal of large epibenthic organisms, with concomitant effects on fish species which occupy these habitats. With ever-increasing demands on fish-stocks and the need for sustainable use of fisheries resources, new approaches to fisheries management are needed. Fisheries management needs to address the sustainability of fish-stocks while minimizing the direct and indirect impacts of fishing on other components of the ecosystem. Two long-term management tools for mitigating degradation or loss of habitat structure while maintaining healthy sustainable fisheries which are increasingly considered by fisheries scientists and managers are: (1) protective habitat management, which involves the designation of protected marine and coastal areas which are afforded some level of protection from fishing; and (2) habitat restoration, whereby important habitat and ecological functions are restored following the loss of habitat and/or resources. Nevertheless, the protection of marine and coastal areas, and habitat restoration should not be seen as solutions replacing conventional management approaches, but need to be components of an integrated programme of coastal zone and fisheries management. A number of recent international fisheries agreements have specifically identified the need to provide for habitat protection and restoration to ensure long-term sustainability of fisheries. The protection and restoration of habitat are also common components of fisheries management programs under national fisheries law and policy.},

abstract = {To remain viable, populations must be resilient to both natural and human-caused environmental changes. We evaluated anthropogenic effects on spatial connections among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) (designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) in the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. For several anthropogenic-effects scenarios, we used graph theory to characterize the spatial relation among populations. We plotted variance in population size against connectivity among populations. In our scenarios, reduced habitat quality decreased the size of populations and hydropower dams on rivers led to the extirpation of several populations, both of which decreased connectivity. Operation of fish hatcheries increased connectivity among populations and led to patchy or panmictic populations. On the basis of our results, we believe recolonization of the upper Cowlitz River by fall and spring Chinook and winter steelhead would best restore metapopulation structure to near-historical conditions. Extant populations that would best conserve connectivity would be those inhabiting the Molalla (spring Chinook), lower Cowlitz, or Clackamas (fall Chinook) rivers and the south Santiam (winter steelhead) and north fork Lewis rivers (summer steelhead). Populations in these rivers were putative sources; however, they were not always the most abundant or centrally located populations. This result would not have been obvious if we had not considered relations among populations in a metapopulation context. Our results suggest that dispersal rate strongly controls interactions among the populations that comprise salmon metapopulations. Thus, monitoring efforts could lead to understanding of the true rates at which wild and hatchery fish disperse. Our application of graph theory allowed us to visualize how metapopulation structure might respond to human activity. The method could be easily extended to evaluations of anthropogenic effects on other stream-dwelling populations and communities and could help prioritize among competing conservation measures.},

Existing supposedly "objective" methods of estimating k ignore this. k can be determined by listing a number of requirements for a good clustering in the given application and finding a k that fulfils them all. The approach is illustrated by application to the problem of finding the number of species in a data set of Australasian tetragonula bees. Requirements here include two new statistics formalising the largest within-cluster gap and cluster separation. Due to the typical nature of expert knowledge, it is difficult to make requirements precise, and a number of subjective decisions is involved.},

@article{Stier2020,
abstract = {Many organisms exhibit tremendous fluctuations in population abundance and experience unexpected collapse. Conservationists seeking to minimize region-wide variability in resources and reduce extinction risk often seek to preserve a metapopulation portfolio of spatially asynchronous subpopulations connected by dispersal. However, portfolio properties are not necessarily static, and the erosion of a portfolio can fundamentally alter the population dynamics and services a species provides. In the Northeast Pacific, a portfolio of spatially asynchronous herring populations has historically provided regional reliability of herring to mobile predators and commercial fishermen as well as local subsistence and ceremonial harvest. Here, we fit a mechanistic time-series model to herring spawn and catch records from 1950 to 2015 to quantify how population growth, climate, and fishing have contributed to a major shift in the herring portfolio over time. We document the erosion of the herring portfolio and a severe decline in herring population growth. Commercial harvest historically played a key role in herring dynamics, hovering around typical annual exploitation rates (15%) at the archipelago scale, but local harvest rates were much higher when fishing occurred (as high as 65%). Additionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on local and regional herring population dynamics. Our results highlight how spatially structured populations can undergo major shifts following disturbance and emphasize how ecological systems do not always rapidly recover and provide services following disturbance. Developing herring management strategies at a finer scale may ensure greater regional resource reliability by recovering previous levels of spatial population asynchrony. However, doing so may require higher implementation and monitoring costs in order to yield higher ecological, social, and economic benefits. Such place-based solutions that match the spatial scale of governance to the spatial scale of ecological dynamics have the potential to improve future management and conservation in an increasingly dynamic world.},

abstract = {Highly valued, hunted, managed, and traded by indigenous people for at least 12,000 years, sea otters share a deep history of interactions with humans along North America's northwest coast. Yet the nineteenth century extirpation and subsequent recovery of sea otters triggered profound ecological, cultural, and socio-economic transformations that continue to elicit complex trade-offs that coastal communities grapple with today. To expand our understanding of past baselines, future recovery targets, and the role First Nations in British Columbia and Alaska once played in altering and managing coastal resources, including sea otters, we synthesized evidence from archeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional knowledge, and contemporary ecological research. Archeological evidence suggests that sea otter hunting was a significant and widespread practice among aboriginal people in this area throughout the Holocene, although the magnitude of use varied spatially. Furthermore, isotopic evidence suggests that over the millennia, sea otters may have been reduced in numbers, existing below carrying capacity, and excluded near human settlements. Furthermore, traditional knowledge and historical records reveal that indigenous peoples of the northwest coast developed diverse technologies to conserve and manage coastal marine resources, such as selective harvesting, seasonal restrictions on use or consumption, and proprietorship that was contingent on sustained productivity. Ancient marine tenure systems and governance protocols based on reciprocity were used to conserve and spatially manage most marine species, including sea otters. Current First Nations perspectives on sea otter conservation and management vary among people and through time as sea otter population status changes, as communities adapt to this perturbation, and as new legal frameworks supporting First Nations rights to co-management emerge.},

abstract = {There is a need to explicitly consider metapopulation dynamics in the development of conservation strategies for spatially-structured populations. We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically-based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identified a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied >90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently other streams make only small contributions to population abundance, however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.},

abstract = {1. Rapid system-wide changes triggered by predators can pose considerable challenges to people. In the Northeast Pacific, the recovery of sea otters Enhydra lutris following their extirpation due to the 18th and 19th century fur trade is driving a social-ecological regime shift with profound implications. While the ecological consequences of this shift are well documented, very little research has examined the conditions that enable or constrain people's ability to adapt to the social, economic and cultural changes that transpire. 2. Through a collaborative partnership and workshops with Indigenous knowledge holders spanning Alaska to British Columbia, along with quantitative and qualitative interviews in two Indigenous communities among the first to experience sea otter recovery, we examined people's perceptions of the social-ecological conditions that affect their ability to adapt to these changes. 3. We found that communities differed in their relative rankings of adaptation-enabling conditions; however, the following four broad strategies were perceived as critical to improving coexistence with sea otters: (a) strengthening Indigenous gov-ernance and decision-making authority; (b) promoting adaptive co-management; (c) weaving Indigenous knowledge and Western science into management plans and (d) establishing learning platforms. Both communities also identified that increased livelihood options and financial assistance would not compensate for lost food security. 4. Differences in enabling conditions and attitudes towards sea otters within and between communities can be attributed to the social-ecological and political context in which sea otter recovery occurs. 5. Our study suggests that enhancing Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to predator induced regime shifts will require a transformation in current resource},

abstract = {For nearly a century, biologists have emphasized the profound importance of spatial scale for ecology, evolution and conservation. Nonetheless, objectively identifying critical scales has proven incredibly challenging. Here we extend new techniques from physics and social sciences that estimate modularity on networks to identify critical scales for movement and gene flow in animals. Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale. We argue that network modularity reveals critical meso-scales that are probably common in populations, providing a powerful means of identifying fundamental scales for biology and for conservation strategies aimed at recovering imperilled species.},

This vast resource includes more than 250,000 lakes and offers angling opportunities for many popular species (e.g., walleye Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum), lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, brook trout S. fontinalis, northern pike Esox lucius, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, largemouth bass M. salmoides, and muskellunge E. masquinongy). In pioneer days, the “apparently inexhaustible abundance of resources” fostered an open-access policy promoting the recreational use of these resources for the benefit of the economy. After World War II, there was a rapid increase in angling effort and by the 1970s many lakes were being overexploited. Clearly, an unrestricted, open-access policy was no longer appropriate. The result has been a rapid proliferation of fishing regulations as exceptions to divisionwide regulations that were created to protect lakes where problems were detected. The growin...},

abstract = {Changes in density-independent mortality can alter the spatial extent of populations through patch extinction and colonization, and spatial contraction may alter population productivity and compensatory capacity. Here, we analyze a time series of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance and examine the hypothesis that spatial contraction can decrease compen- satory capacity. Over the last 20 years, steelhead in the Keogh River have declined by an order of magnitude because of a period of poor smolt-to-adult survival. Low abundance has been associated with more depressed production of out-migrating smolts than would be expected based on traditional models of compensatory dynamics. Patterns of juvenile density over time show changes in the spatial distribution of the population. We developed a spatially explicit population model to explore spatial structure and juvenile recruitment under varying marine survival. Results suggest that spatial contraction during a period of poor marine survival can strengthen density-dependent population regulation, reducing smolt production at the watershed scale. Our results highlight that spatial contraction can alter the fundamental density-dependent relationships that define population dynamics, recovery trajectories, and sustainable harvest levels of spatially structured populations},

abstract = {The spatial dispersal of individuals is known to play an important role in the dynamics of populations, and is central to metapopulation theory. At the same time, local adaptation to environmental conditions creates a geographic mosaic of evolutionary forces, where the combined drivers of selection and gene flow interact. Although the dispersal of individuals from donor to recipient populations provides connections within the metapopulation, promoting demographic and evolutionary rescue, it may also introduce maladapted individuals into habitats host to different environmental conditions, potentially lowering the fitness of the recipient population. Here we explore a model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics between two populations connected by dispersal, where the productivity of each is defined by a trait complex that is subject to local selection. Although general in nature, our model is inspired by salmon metapopulations, where dispersal between populations is defined in terms of the straying rate, which has been shown to be density-dependent. The results of our model reveal that increased straying between evolving populations leads to alternative stable states, which has large and nonlinear effects on two measures of metapopulation robustness: the portfolio effect and the time to recovery following an induced disturbance. We show that intermediate levels of straying result in large gains in robustness, and that increased habitat heterogeneity promotes robustness when straying rates are low, and erodes robustness when straying rates are high. Finally, we show that density-dependent straying promotes robustness, particularly when the aggregate biomass is low and straying is correspondingly high, which has important ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both natural and anthropogenic disturbances.},

abstract = {Winter mortality has been documented in a large number of freshwater fish populations, and a smaller, but increasing, number of marine and estuarine fishes. The impacted populations include a number of important North American and European resource species, yet the sources of winter mortality remain unidentified in most populations where it has been documented. Among the potential sources, thermal stress and starvation have received the most research attention. Other sources including predation and pathogens have significant impacts but have received insufficient attention to date. Designs of more recent laboratory experiments have reflected recognition of the potential for interactions among these co-occurring stressors. Geographic patterns in winter mortality are, in some cases, linked to latitudinal clines in winter severity and variability. However, for many freshwater species in particular, the effects of local community structure (predators and prey) may overwhelm latitudinal patterns. Marine (and estuarine) systems differ from freshwater systems in several aspects important to overwintering fishes, the most important being the lack of isolating barriers in the ocean. While open population boundaries allow fish to adopt migration strategies minimizing exposure to thermal stresses, they may retard rates of evolution to local environments. Geographic patterns in the occurrence and causes of winter mortality are ultimately determined by the interaction of regional and local factors. Winter mortality impacts population dynamics through episodic depressions in stock size and regulation of annual cohort strength. While the former tends to act in a density-independent manner, the latter can be density dependent, as most sources of mortality tend to select against the smallest members of the cohort and population. Most stock assessment and management regimes have yet to explicitly incorporate the variability in winter mortality. Potential management responses include postponement of cohort evaluation (to after first winter of life), harvest restrictions following mortality events and habitat enhancement. Future research should place more emphasis on the ecological aspects of winter mortality including the influences of food-web structure on starvation and predation. Beyond illuminating an understudied life-history phase, studies of overwintering ecology are integral to contemporary issues in fisheries ecology including ecosystem management, habitat evaluation, and impacts of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

abstract = {Biodiversity targets, or estimates of the quantities of biodiversity features that should be conserved in a region, are fundamental to systematic conservation planning. We propose that targets for species should be based on the quantitative thresholds developed for the Vulnerable category of the IUCN Red List system, thereby avoiding future listings of species in an IUCN Red List threat category or an increase in the extinction risk, or ultimate extinction, of species already listed as threatened. Examples of this approach are presented for case studies from South Africa, including threatened taxa listed under the IUCN Red List criteria of A to D, a species listed as Near Threatened, a species of conservation concern due to its rarity, and one species in need of recovery. The method gives rise to multiple representation targets, an improvement on the often used single representation targets that are inadequate for long term maintenance of biodiversity or the arbitrary multiple representation and percentage targets that are sometimes adopted. Through the implementation of the resulting conservation plan, these targets will ensure that the conservation status of threatened species do not worsen over time by qualifying for higher categories of threat and may actually improve their conservation status by eliminating the threat of habitat loss and stabilizing population declines. The positive attributes ascribed to the IUCN Red List system, and therefore to the species targets arising from this approach, are important when justifying decisions that limit land uses known to be detrimental to biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations.

We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

However, the underlying theoretical models tended to assume high productivity, making the conservation benefit of metapopulation structure uncertain for endangered species with low productivity. We simulated population assemblages (N = 50) of diadromous fishes under high to low productivity scenarios to explicitly assess how straying (movement from natal to non-natal rivers) contributes to changes in species abundance and extinction risk. The population aggregation exhibited greater total abundance from source–sink dynamics and also exhibited the rescue effect when productivity remained moderately high. However, straying did not ensure persistence of nonviable populations or enable population re-establishment when productivity was low. These results were robust to a wide range of alternate spatial and life-history parameterizations of the simulation model. Relative to a real-world population aggregation of endangered Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), our results would argue for a shift in remediation priorities to prevent extinction. Although there is strong evolutionary justification for maintaining widespread distributions of endangered diadromous species, the immediate numerical consequences of this approach may hinder recovery.},

abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the spatial scale of population structure is fundamental to long-standing tenets of population biology, landscape ecology and conservation. Nonetheless, identifying such scales has been challenging because a key factor that influences scaling – movement among patches or local populations – is a multicausal process with substantial phenotypic and temporal variation. 2. We resolve this problem via a novel application of network modularity. When applied to move-ments, modularity provides a formal description of the functional aggregation of populations and identifies potentially critical scales for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We first test for mod-ularity using several different types of biologically relevant movements across the entire geographic range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). We then ask whether variation in movement based on (i) age, (ii) sex and (iii) time (annual, seasonal and within-season movements) influences spatial population structure (i.e. modularity) in snail kites. 3. We identified significant modularity in annual dispersal of snail kites (all adults, males only, females only, and juveniles only) and in within-breeding season movements of adults, yet no evidence of modularity in seasonal (non-breeding) movements. For those movements with observed modular structure, we found striking similarities in the spatial configuration of population structure, even though movement properties varied considerably among these dif-ferent types of movements. 4. Our results suggest that the emergence of modularity in population networks can be robust despite movement heterogeneity and differences in patch-based measures of connectivity. Fur-thermore, our comparison of the population structure and connectivity across multiple move-ment phases helps to identify wetland patches most critical to population connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales. 5. We argue that understanding modularity in populations may provide a robust complement to existing measures of population structure and connectivity and will help to clarify the lim-iting roles of movement for populations. Such information is increasingly needed for inter-preting population persistence and guiding effective conservation strategies with ongoing environmental change.},

abstract = {1. This paper describes a novel approach to modelling of metapopulation dynamics. The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. 2. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. 3. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4. The model is fitted to data from three butterfly metapopulations. The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate). The results suggest that local populations of the three butterflies in patches of 1 ha, which may support of the order of 1000 adult butterflies, have an expected lifetime of 20-100 years.},

Both theory and empirical information support the conclusion that most density-de-pendent change occurs at high population levels (close to the carrying capacity) for species with life history strategies typical of large mammals. The reverse is true for species with life history strategies typical of insects and some fishes. Theoretical considerations that give rise to these conclusions involve natural selection and trophic dynamics. There is a large body of literature that contains descriptions of density dependence as based on empirical observations. These data, and the models used to represent them, indicate that species with high reproductive rates, short life-spans and pop-ulations held below the limits of environmental resources exhibit most density-dependent change at low population levels. Similar data for species with low reproductive rates, long life-spans and pop-ulations that are more limited by resources (large mammals in particular) indicate that most density-dependent changes in vital rates occur at levels of the population quite close to the carrying capacity.},

abstract = {Recent surveys of recovery plans indicate that criteria, such as population sizes, for delisting species from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) are often unrealistically low by scientific standards. We describe the delisting criterion for the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) developed by the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Team. A major oil spill is the most serious threat to this sea otter population. After extensive modeling of oil spills, the recovery team concluded that it was not scientifically defensible to develop a delisting criterion in terms of a single probability of extinction over a specified time period. Instead, the team decided to define a size at which it would consider the population endangered and to consider the population threatened as long as a major oil spill might reduce it to that size. The effective population size (N(c)) for endangered status was set at 500, estimated to be about 1850 otters. Using a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez spill (250,000 bbl), the oil spill model was iterated to generate a frequency distribution of the number of sea otters contacted by oil, from which the team estimated that less than 800 otters would be killed by 90% of the simulated spills. Thus, the delisting criterion was set at 1850 + 800 = 2650 individuals. There have been several proposals to improve the Endangered Species Act by providing quantitative guidance, in the form of specific probabilities of extinction within some time frame or specific criteria like those used by the World Conservation Union as to the levels of extinction risk represented by the terms 'threatened' and 'endangered.' Experiences of the Sea Otter Recovery Team indicate that guidelines should not be overly rigid and should allow flexibility for dealing with specific situations. The most important consideration is to appoint a recovery team that is both technically well qualified and unconstrained by pressures from management agencies.},

@article{Heino2017,
abstract = {We use an individual-based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an "evolutionary rescue" in a fragmented landscape. Kin competition has a quantitative effect on the evolution of migration rate in our model, but these patterns in the evolution of migration rate appear to be primarily caused by spatiotemporal variation in fitness and mortality during migration. We apply the model to real habitat patch networks occupied by two checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea) species, for which sufficient data are available to estimate rigorously most of the model parameters. The model-predicted migration rate is not significantly different from the empirically observed one. Regional variation in patch areas and connectivities leads to regional variation in the optimal migration rate, predictions that can be tested empirically.},

abstract = {The degradation of habitats due to human activities is a major topic of interest for the conservation and management of wild populations. There is growing evidence that the Florida Everglades ecosystem continues to suffer from habitat degradation. After a period of recovery in the 1990s, the Snail Kite Rostrhamus sociabilis population suffered a substantial decline in 2001 and has not recovered since. Habitat degradation has been suggested as one of the primary reasons for this lack of recovery. As a consequence of the continued degradation of the Everglades, we hypothesized that this would have led to increased movement of juvenile Kites over time, as a consequence of the need to find more favourable habitat. We used multistate mark-recapture models to compare between-site movement probabilities of juvenile Snail Kites in the 1990s (1992-95; which corresponds to the period before the decline) and 2000s (2003-06; after the decline). Our analyses were based on an extensive radiotelemetry study (266 birds tracked monthly over the entire state of Florida for a total period of 6 years) and considered factors such as sex and age of marked individuals. There was evidence of increased movement of juvenile Snail Kites during the post-decline period from most of the wetland regions used historically by Kites. Higher movement rates may contribute to an increase in the probability of mortality of young individuals and could contribute to the observed declines. -{\textregistered} 2012 The Authors.

@article{Warner1985,
abstract = {For most species, a changeable environment creates a situation in which recruitment varies considerably from one breeding season to the next. If adults survive well, an occasional favorable recruitment can sustain population numbers over long periods. In effect, the gains made in favorable periods are stored in the adult population. Storage is particularly important when the species is at low densities, because then the potential population growth rate is very high if a favorable period occurs. Our past work showed that the storage mechanism could lead to coexistence of two species in lottery competition for space, as long as generations overlapped and there was sufficient variation in recruitment (Chesson and Warner 1981). This was true even if one species had an average competitive advantage. The storage model also operates when more than two species are competing, when resources renew independently of population sizes, and when not all the resource is used. It also operates in simple Lotka-Volterra systems in which adults do not compete directly with juveniles. The field ecologist is faced with the more practical problem of determining whether the storage mechanism is operating in a particular system. Species with relatively long lives and high fecundities are most likely to enjoy the benefits of the storage effect. Environments that theoretically elicit these life history characteristics are relatively benign and permanent for established adults, but are such that births and/or juvenile survivorship vary widely. Trees and many marine organisms are examples of species with the proper life histories, and storage may be important in maintaining the high diversity of these communities. The storage mechanism is capable of independently maintaining species coexistence, and we provide some suggestions on how to distinguish qualitatively the operation of storage from alternative mechanisms. We expect, however, that storage will make some positive contribution toward species persistence in nearly all communities, and we give a method for estimating empirically how large that contribution is.},

Much attention has been paid to lattice-type networks, such as patch-based metapopulations, but interest in understanding ecological networks of alternative geometries is building. Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) include some increasingly threatened ecological systems, such as caves and streams. The restrictive architecture of dendritic ecological networks might have overriding implications for species persistence. I used a modeling approach to investigate how number and spatial arrangement of habitat patches influence metapopulation extinction risk in 2 DENs of different size and topology. Metapopulation persistence was higher in larger networks, but this relationship was mediated by network topology and the dispersal pathways used to navigate the network. Larger networks, especially those with greater topological complexity, generally had lower extinction risk than smaller and less-complex networks, but dispersal bias and magnitude affected the shape of this relationship. Applying these general results to real systems will require empirical data on the movement behavior of organisms and will improve our understanding of the implications of network complexity on population and community patterns and processes},

abstract = {Worldwide depletion of fish stocks has led fisheries managers to become increasingly concerned about rebuilding and recovery planning. To succeed, factors affecting recovery dynamics need to be understood, including the role of fisheries-induced evolution. Here we investigate a stock's response to fishing followed by a harvest moratorium by analyzing an individual-based evolutionary model parameterized for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from its northern range, representative of long-lived, late-maturing species. The model allows evolution of life-history processes including maturation, reproduction, and growth. It also incorporates environmental variability, phenotypic plasticity, and density-dependent feedbacks. Fisheries-induced evolution affects recovery in several ways. The first decades of recovery were dominated by demographic and density-dependent processes. Biomass rebuilding was only lightly influenced by fisheries-induced evolution, whereas other stock characteristics such as maturation age, spawning stock biomass, and recruitment were substantially affected, recovering to new demographic equilibria below their preharvest levels. This is because genetic traits took thousands of years to evolve back to preharvest levels, indicating that natural selection driving recovery of these traits is weaker than fisheries-induced selection was. Our results strengthen the case for proactive management of fisheries-induced evolution, as the restoration of genetic traits altered by fishing is slow and may even be impractical. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

We provide a regional metapopulation analysis to inform conservation management for Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in five subpopulations defined by land management designations. We used data from an individual-based mark–recapture study to estimate subpopulation sizes, subpopulation growth rates, and movement probabilities among subpopulations. We assessed the source–sink structure of the study population by calculating source–sink statistics, and we created a female-based matrix metapopulation model composed of all subpopulations to examine how variation in demographic components of survival, reproduction, and movement affected metapopulation growth rate. Movement data indicated no subpopulation was completely isolated, but movement probabilities varied among subpopulations. Source–sink statistics and net flow of individuals indicated three subpopulations were sources, while two subpopulations were sinks. We found areas with higher wildlife protection efforts and fewer anthropogenic impacts were sources, and less-protected areas were identified as sinks. Our results highlight the importance of identifying source–sink dynamics among subpopulations for effective conservation planning and emphasize how protected areas can play an important role in sustaining metapopulations.},

abstract = {Establishment of marine protected areas, including fully protected marine reserves, is one of the few management tools available for local communities to combat the deleterious effect of large scale environmental impacts, including global climate change, on ocean ecosystems. Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection.},

Percent survival at the end of 210 d was significantly lower in starved small (3.3%) and medium (6.7%) fish than in fed small (95.1%) and medium (98.4%) fish. Large fish showed 100% survival regardless of feeding regime. In years of large, prolonged runoff that delays the seasonal warming of the upper Colorado River, late spawning by Colorado squawfish leaves age-0 fish with only 2 months to grow and accumulate fat reserves before the onset of winter.

Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of gray wolves less than 14 years after their reintroduction to Idaho and Wyoming. The "delisting" rule does not adequately address lack of genetic connectivity between Yellowstone wolf packs and other NRM populations, for which reason a federal court overturned the 2008 predecessor of the rule. The US Fish and Wildlife Service defies its own policies by delisting the Idaho and Montana portions of the DPS while Wyoming wolves remain endangered. Criteria for this delisting are inconsistent with prior delistings of recovered birds and mammals. New scientific understanding of species recovery argues for a higher delisting threshold for the NRM gray wolf metapopulation. Finally, we argue that ecosystem recovery should be a recovery criterion for this unique keystone predator. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological. Sciences. All rights reserved.},

@article{Thorson2014,
abstract = {Spatial, phenotypic and genetic diversity at relatively small scales can buffer species against large-scale processes such as climate change that tend to synchronize populations and increase temporal variability in overall abundance or production. This portfolio effect generally results in improved biological and economic outcomes for managed species. Previous evidence for the portfolio effect in salmonids has arisen from examinations of time series of adult abundance, but we lack evidence of spatial buffering of temporal variability in demographic rates such as survival of juveniles during their first year of life. We therefore use density-dependent population models with multiple random effects to represent synchronous (similar among populations) and asynchronous (different among populations) temporal variability as well as spatial variability in survival. These are fitted to 25 years of survey data for breeding adults and surviving juveniles from 15 demographically distinct populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within a single metapopulation in the Snake River in Idaho, USA. Model selection identifies the most support for the model that included both synchronous and asynchronous temporal variability, in addition to spatial variability. Asynchronous variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}55) is approximately equal in magnitude to synchronous temporal variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}67), but much lower than spatial variability (log-SD = 1{\textperiodcentered}11). We also show that the pairwise correlation coefficient, a common measure of population synchrony, is approximated by the estimated ratio of shared and total variance, where both approaches yield a synchrony estimate of 0{\textperiodcentered}59. We therefore find evidence for spatial buffering of temporal variability in early juvenile survival, although between-population variability that persists over time is also large. We conclude that spatial variation decreases interannual changes in overall juvenile production, which suggests that conservation and restoration of spatial diversity will improve population persistence for this metapopulation. However, the exact magnitude of spatial buffering depends upon demographic parameters such as adult survival that may vary among populations and is proposed as an area of future research using hierarchical life cycle models. We recommend that future sampling of this metapopulation employ a repeated-measure sampling design to improve estimation of early juvenile carrying capacity. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

Here, we document the recovery of a species from former population refuges. An extensive survey of the entire British range of Hesperia comma, conducted in 2000, recorded over three times the number of tetrads (2 km x 2 km grid squares) occupied in 1982. This was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the number of populations and a 10-fold increase in the habitat area occupied. The improving status of H. comma is the product of good habitat management, recovering rabbit populations and climate warming, which have improved the quality, and increased the availability, of suitable habitat. This has enabled remnant metapopulations to expand, via distance-dependent colonisation, through large networks of habitat. Metapopulation recovery in H. comma demonstrates that landscape-scale conservation can be successful. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conservation and management increasingly focus on connectivity, because connectivity driven by variation in immigration rates across landscapes is thought to be crucial for maintaining local population and metapopulation persistence. Yet, efforts to quantify the relative role of immigration on population growth across the entire range of species and over time have been lacking. We assessed whether immigration limited local and range-wide population growth of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA, over 18 years using multi-state, reverse-time modelling that accounts for imperfect detection of individuals and unobservable states. Demographic contributions of immigration varied depending on the dynamics and geographic position of the local populations, were scale-dependent and changed over time. By comparing the relative contributions of immigration versus local demography for periods of significant change in local abundance, we found empirical evidence for a disproportionately large role of immigration in facilitating population growth of a centrally located population—a connectivity ‘hub'. The importance of connectivity changed depending of the spatial scale considered, such that immigration was a more important driver of population growth at small versus large spatial scales. Furthermore, the contribution of immigration was much greater during time periods when local population size was small, emphasizing abundance-dependent rescue effects. Our findings suggest that efforts aimed at improving local breeding habitat will likely be most effective at increasing snail kite population growth. More broadly, our results provide much needed information on the role of connectivity for population growth, suggesting that connectivity conservation may have the greatest benefits when efforts focus on centrally located habitat patches and small populations. Furthermore, our results highlight that connectivity is highly dynamic over time and that interpreting the effects of connectivity at local scales may not transfer to region-wide dynamics.},

abstract = {Despite broad recognition of the potential for significant spatial complexity in morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (. Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations.},

It is only recently that ecologists have fully realized that a relatively simple general theory can be readily constructed that makes some of the simplifying assumptions of the two earlier theories unnecessary. The spatially realistic metapopulation theory thereby provides a more unified framework for spatial ecology than the island theory or the classical metapopulation theory. This article describes the application of the spatially realistic metapopulation theory to real metapopulations living in highly fragmented landscapes.

While previous efforts to describe homing, or natal site fidelity, of migratory organisms have been hindered by the confounding effects of fragmented landscapes and management practices, realistic conservation efforts must include considerations of the behavioral diversity represented by animal movements and dispersal. Herein, we quantify straying away from natal origins by adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in a wild population that inhabits a pristine wilderness basin. Using natural isotopic signatures (87Sr/ 86Sr) to reconstruct the migratory behaviors of unhandled individuals over their entire life cycle, we identified ecological and behavioral factors influencing the propensity to stray. Our results indicate that natal site fidelity is scale dependent, ranging from 55% at ∼1-km distances to 87% at longer (>10-km scale) distances, and juvenile dispersal and sex highly influence straying occurrence. These findings lend support for the conservation of behavioral diversity for population persistence, and we propose straying as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity at low population densities. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {1. It has been suggested that the habitats which a species occupies can be divided into sources and sinks, depending on whether or not local reproduction is sufficient to balance mortality. Source populations are those where reproduction exceeds mortality, surplus individuals dispersing to sink populations where mortality exceeds local reproduction. Sink populations would not be viable in the absence of immigration. 2. A difference equation model is constructed to show that sources and sinks cannot be identified from a simple comparison of the demographic rates between populations, as measured by the numbers of births and deaths. 3. Viable populations may appear to be non-viable simply because the dispersal of individuals into them depresses fecundity or increases mortality as a result of density-dependence. The consequence is that local recruitment appears insufficient to balance local mortality. 4. Viable populations that appear as sinks, as a result of the dispersal of individuals into them, are termed here as `pseudo-sinks'. They will clearly be difficult to distinguish from genuine sinks on the basis of a simple comparison of the numbers of births and deaths in different populations. 5. Examples of source and genuine sink populations and the data required to establish them are discussed.},

abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

abstract = {Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in conservation and population biology, but the standard approach has also been criticized for being too restrictive, as it is based on the effects of habitat patch area and isolation only. Here we demonstrate how the effects of habitat quality (extra environmental factors) and detailed landscape structure (described with GIS [Geographical Information System]) can be included in a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. Expanded models are tested with a large data set on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). The incidence function model supplemented with additional environmental factors revealed some new and confirmed some previously known interactions between M. cinxia and its environment. However, the ability of the additional environmental factors to explain the error in the fit of the basic model was generally low (less than or equal to 15%). In the second variant of the basic model, landscape structure was used to modify effective patch isolations. This approach, though biologically appealing, failed to improve significantly the fit of the incidence function model. There are several possible reasons for this failure, including inaccurate satellite data, problems with habitat classification, and most importantly, generic problems in the modeling of migration. Our results demonstrate that additional complexity beyond the effects of habitat patch area and isolation does not necessarily improve the predictive power of a metapopulation model.},

This leads to false impressions of the past, inaccurate baselines, and unrealistic recovery goals. Idaho biologists have counted Chinook salmon redds for >60 consecutive years, generating an invaluable database; however, inaccurate historical baselines compromise the utility of even such high-quality, long-term databases. To develop an accurate baseline, we integrated archival (1951–1964), maximum redd counts with contemporary (1995–2017), continuous counts and spawn timing datasets to estimate historical (1950s–1960s) wild Chinook salmon production potential. Current salmon populations average 3% of 1950s–1960s abundances, which may have been 30% of precommercial fishery (1880s) populations. Notably, the SBS has influenced contemporary managers as reflected in minimum viable abundance, sustainable escapement, and adequate seeding objectives equaling 10.4%, 17.9%, and 20.4%, respectively, of 1950s–1960s potential. Our approach provides a framework for utilizing archival and contemporary data to reconstruct historical baselines and repress SBS. Contrasting contemporary goals with maximum production potential provides new reference points and perspectives for managers to consider.},

abstract = {Evolutionary effects of fishing can have unwanted consequences diminishing a fishery's value and sustainability. Reserves, or no-take areas, have been proposed as a management tool for reducing fisheries-induced selection, but their effectiveness for migratory species has remained unexplored. Here we develop an eco-genetic model to predict the effects of marine reserves on fisheries-induced evolution under migration. To represent a stock that undergoes an annual migration between feeding and spawning grounds, we draw model parameters from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern part of its range. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) a reserve in a stock's feeding grounds, protecting immature and mature fish alike, reduces fisheries-induced evolution, even though protected and unprotected population components mix on the spawning grounds; (ii) in contrast, a reserve in a stock's spawning grounds, protecting only mature fish, has little mitigating effects on fisheries-induced evolution and can sometimes even exacerbate its magnitude; (iii) evolutionary changes that are already underway may be difficult to reverse with a reserve; (iv) directly after a reserve is created or enlarged, most reserve scenarios result in yield losses; and (v) timescale is very important: short-term yield losses immediately after a reserve's creation can give way to long-term gains. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {In marine populations, spatial structure arises over a wide range of scales and forms hierarchical aggregations. Changing spatial structure can alter the demographic and life history trait variation within populations and subject individuals to both novel environmental conditions and interspecific interactions. Thus, changes in the spatial structure of marine populations can be a prelude to further changes in abundance and can affect the resilience and recovery potential of populations following anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. These observations under - score the importance of studying the spatial ecology of marine fish populations in order to (1) understand the underlying mechanisms that can lead to rapid alterations in population abundance and community interactions, (2) provide indicators of stock health, and (3) characterize the consequences of changing spatial patterns on population susceptibility to exploitation and environmental variability. Here, we synthesize the interacting factors that influence the formation, maintenance and erosion of spatial structure in marine fish populations and identify the further con sequences of such erosion at the population and community levels. We emphasize human driven changes of population spatial structure for 3 levels of population genetic aggregation that are common in fisheries management scenarios, namely sympatric populations, metapopulations and panmictic populations. Case studies are presented for each level of aggregation. Throughout our review, we both summarize the factors that link spatial and temporal dynamics in marine populations and highlight the management and conservation implications of such linkages. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract = {Aim: Understanding the biodiversity–stability relationship has become a central issue in ecology and conservation biology. Although the stabilizing effects of tree species diversity on ecosystem productivity are well recorded in small local communities, they remain poorly understood across scales (from local to larger spatial scales). This study evaluates biodiversity–stability effects from local to larger spatial scales in a large temperate forest region, considering a range of environmental conditions and environmental heterogeneity. Location: North-eastern China (c. 700,000 km2). Time period: 2005–2017. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: We define stability as the temporal invariability of biomass productivity. Regional metacommunities representing larger spatial scales were developed by aggregating multiple sets of local field plots. Simple regression analysis was used to test biodiversity–stability relationships in metacommunities. Piecewise structural equation modelling was then used to disentangle the effects of diversity and abiotic variables on forest stability at local and larger spatial scales. Multiple mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the relative contribution of individual predictive variables to stability across spatial scales. Results: We found that local diversity (alpha diversity) was positively related to the stability of local communities (alpha stability), whereas species turnover across space (beta diversity) was positively related to asynchronous dynamics among local communities (spatial asynchrony), regardless of whether abiotic factors were considered or not. We also found that environmental conditions and environmental heterogeneity affected forest stability across scales. The effect of spatial asynchrony on gamma stability was greater than that of alpha stability. Main conclusions: Our results imply that spatial asynchrony is a key to maintaining the stability of ecosystem productivity within a large temperate forest region. We suggest that diverse forests and heterogeneous landscapes should be sustained at multiple spatial scales to buffer the negative effects of climate change and forest degradation.},

The increased availability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that the number of spawners produced per spawner each year at low populations, i.e., the maximum annual reproductive rate, is relatively constant within species and that there is relatively little variation among species. This quantity can be interpreted as a standardized slope at the origin of a spawner–recruitment function. We employ variance components models that assume that the log of the standardized slope at the origin is a normal random variable. This approach allows improved estimates of spawner–recruitment parameters, estimation of empirical prior distributions for Bayesian analysis, estimation of the biological limits of fishing, calculation of the maximum sustainable yield, and impact assessment of dams and pollution.},

abstract = {Current debates about the efficacy of no-take marine reserves (MR) in protecting large pelagic fish such as tuna and sharks have usually not considered the evolutionary dimension of this issue, which emerges because the propensity to swim away from a given place, like any other biological trait, will probably vary in a heritable fashion among individuals. Here, based on spatially explicit simulations, we investigated whether selection to remain in MRs to avoid higher fishing mortality can lead to the evolution of more philopatric fish. Our simulations, which covered a range of life histories among tuna species (skipjack tuna vs. Atlantic bluefin tuna) and shark species (great white sharks vs. spiny dogfish), suggested that MRs were most effective at maintaining viable population sizes when movement distances were lowest. Decreased movement rate evolved following the establishment of marine reserves, and this evolution occurred more rapidly with higher fishing pressure. Evolutionary reductions in movement rate led to increases in within-reserve population sizes over the course of the 50 years following MR establishment, although this varied among life histories, with skipjack responding fastest and great white sharks slowest. Our results suggest the evolution of decreased movement can augment the efficacy of marine reserves, especially for species, such as skipjack tuna, with relatively short generation times. Even when movement rates did not evolve substantially over 50 years (e.g., given long generation times or little heritable variation), marine reserves were an effective tool for the conservation of fish populations when mean movement rates were low or MRs were large.},

Runs declined as a result of hydroelectric development of the river; the main cause for the decline was the mortality of juveniles migrating downstream through as many as nine dams and impoundments en route to the ocean. Mid-Columbia River summer chinook salmon runs experienced the greatest decline because of higher mortalities incurred during their migration to sea as subyearlings in July and August. Mortality was lower for remaining races of fish that migrate to sea as yearlings in the spring during higher river flows, more spill at dams, and cooler water temperatures. Enhancement measures to offset dam-related mortality of smolts began in 1970 on the Snake River and in 1975 on the mid-Columbia River. These measures included increased numbers of smolts released from hatcheries, spillway deflectors to reduce dissolved gas saturation, fingerling bypasses at dams, transportation of smolts around dams, supplemental river flows to minimize delay for smolts passing through reservoirs, and supplemental spill at dams to minimize turbine mortality of smolts at dams without fingerling bypasses. These actions have reversed the decline of steelhead but not of salmon. Enhancement has improved the rate of return of wild spring chinook salmon, but wild fish contribution is minimal at this time because stocks were reduced by earlier hydroelectric development. Presently, runs are mostly of hatchery origin and have not responded well to enhancement. Mortality of hatchery fish may be due to activation of bacterial kidney disease by stresses encountered during downriver migrations, transportation, or subsequent transition into seawater.},

In this study, we (1) provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that source-sink systems help maintain some of the ungulate populations in the Lacandon Forest, Mexico; and (2) test the assumptions that density, age structure, and sex ratios are different in slightly hunted (potential sources) and persistently hunted (potential sinks) populations. From May 1998 to March 2001 we observed 1144 individuals and 1153 tracks of five ungulate species (Baird's tapir, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, red brocket deer, and white-tailed deer) along 1908 km of line transects in slightly and persistently hunted sites of Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (MABR) and adjacent community lands. Densities of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary were lower in persistently hunted sites, where there were higher proportions of young tapirs and white-tailed deer. The sustainability of hunting was evaluated in five communities using information on harvest rates, production rates, and density of each population. Our results suggest that persistently hunted populations of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary are at risk of local extinction, while collared peccary hunting appears to be sustainable. The red brocket deer, although locally overhunted, maintains a relatively safe status probably through a source-sink system in which MABR functions as the source of individuals which are readily hunted in adjacent community lands. Source-sink systems may be also important in maintaining Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary populations outside protected areas of the Lacandon Forest, from evidence of migration observed during this study. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.},

abstract = {Use of extensive but low-resolution abundance data is common in the assessment of species at-risk status based on quantitative decline criteria under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and national endangered species legislation. Such data can be problematic for 3 reasons. First, statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no change is often low because of small sample size and high sampling uncertainty leading to a high frequency of type II errors. Second, range-wide assessments composed of multiple site-specific observations do not effectively weight site-specific trends into global trends. Third, uncertainty in site-specific temporal trends and relative abundance are not propagated at the appropriate spatial scale. A common result is the propensity to underestimate the magnitude of declines and therefore fail to identify the appropriate at-risk status for a species. We used 3 statistical approaches, from simple to more complex, to estimate temporal decline rates for a designatable unit (DU) of rainbow trout in the Athabasca River watershed in western Canada. This DU is considered a native species for purposes of listing because of its genetic composition characterized as >0.95 indigenous origin in the face of continuing introgressive hybridization with introduced populations in the watershed. Analysis of abundance trends from 57 time series with a fixed-effects model identified 33 sites with negative trends, but only 2 were statistically significant. By contrast, a hierarchical linear mixed model weighted by site-specific abundance provided a DU-wide decline estimate of 16.4% per year and a 3-generation decline of 93.2%. A hierarchical Bayesian mixed model yielded a similar 3-generation decline trend of 91.3% and the posterior distribution showed that the estimate had a >99% probability of exceeding thresholds for an endangered listing. We conclude that the Bayesian approach was the most useful because it provided a probabilistic statement of threshold exceedance in support of an at-risk status recommendation.},

After verifying the model's accuracy, using historical trajectories for size at maturation in cod (Gadus morhua), we test model predictions under different management schemes with life history parameters for red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and two rockfish species (Sebastes paucispinis and S. ruberrimus). The model results show that notake MPAs can protect against strong fisheries-based selection for earlier maturation. The potential to protect against anthropogenic selection declines with increasing fragmentation of reserves to networks of small reserves. Accounting for the evolution of size at maturation increases the predicted biomass contribution from MPA populations to harvested populations. Traditional management approaches, such as adjustments to harvest rate and maximum size limits, can lead to equivalent protection against anthropogenic selection and equivalent or greater long-term biomass yield than establishing MPAs; however, the protection and yield from establishing no-take MPAs appears more robust to uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Parametric and nonparametric kernel methods dominate studies of animal home ranges and space use. Most existing methods are unable to incorporate information about the underlying physical environment, leading to poor performance in excluding areas that are not used. Using radio-telemetry data from sea otters, we developed and evaluated a new algorithm for estimating home ranges (hereafter Permissible Home Range Estimation, or "PHRE") that reflects habitat suitability. We began by transforming sighting locations into relevant landscape features (for sea otters, coastal position and distance from shore). Then, we generated a bivariate kernel probability density function in landscape space and back-transformed this to geographic space in order to define a permissible home range. Compared to two commonly used home range estimation methods, kernel densities and local convex hulls, PHRE better excluded unused areas and required a smaller sample size. Our PHRE method is applicable to species whose ranges are restricted by complex physical boundaries or environmental gradients and will improve understanding of habitat-use requirements and, ultimately, aid in conservation efforts.},

abstract = {After near extinction as a result of the fur trade in the 1700s and 1800s, the southern sea otter slowly reoccupied the core of its range in central California. Range expansion beyond central California is seen as key to full recovery of otters, but the rate of expansion has been sporadic, raising concerns about habitat quality in southern California. To describe the range expansion of sea otters from central into southern California, we used skiff surveys, aerial surveys, and archival time-depth recorders from 2004 to 2013. These observations show that range expansion began when male otters swam southeast of Point Conception (Cojo Anchorage), perhaps to seek refuge from bad weather and to feed on unexploited resources. After several years of seasonal use by male groups, females began to use the area, leading to reproduction and a secondary increase in abundance. In contrast, a second male group that moved farther down the coast to Coal Oil Point stalled and retreated. Such range expansion and contraction can be explained by the social nature of sea otters, which acts to slow dispersal away from groups. Otter densities at Cojo Anchorage are now approaching equilibrium levels reported for central California. As in central California, otters rested in and near kelp forest habitat, but used deeper water for foraging. Together, these observations suggest habitat in the Santa Barbara Channel can still support sea otters, but range expansion of otters into southern California will be episodic due to social dynamics.

This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a ‘reservoir' of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context.},

In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

Here I discuss several branches of conservation science in which sea otter researchers have used mathematical models to aid in their research, including behavior, population dynamics, community interactions, and applied conservation questions. For each subject area, I explain some of the key research questions, provide examples of how models have been used to help answer those questions, and highlight promising areas for future and ongoing work in sea otter conservation.

abstract = {The way in which density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal are key in determining the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations. Here we propose a mechanistic approach to understanding how the relative importance of these sources of density dependence can change over ontogeny through changes in dispersal abilities, energy stores and mortality risks. Whereas the potential for active dispersal typically increases over ontogeny as a function of body size, susceptibility to starvation and predation decreases. The joint effect of these mechanisms suggests a general model for the ontogenetic sequence of how density dependence is manifested, with density dependence early in ontogeny being primarily expressed as mortality on local spatial scales, whereas later stages respond to local density in terms of dispersal and potentially growth. Here we test this model by manipulating the densities of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at two life-history stages in the wild. Density-dependent mortality during the early juvenile stage (i.e. fry at onset of exogenous feeding) was accompanied by no effects on body size and weak effects on dispersal. In contrast, dispersal of older juveniles (i.e. parr 2-3 months after onset of feeding) was strongly density-dependent, with more individuals emigrating from high-density release sites, and with no effect of initial density on mortality. This dispersal, however, appeared insufficient to produce an ideal free distribution within the study stream, as indicated by the effect of spatial variation in density on body size by the end of the first growth season. These results demonstrate that the way density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal changes throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, these changes occur in correlation with changes in individual mortality risks and dispersal abilities, and suggest a general paradigm for the way in which juvenile density-dependence is manifest in spatially structured populations of highly fecund organisms.

abstract = {1. Spatial within-population heterogeneity in density probably affects competition intensity and may have a fundamental role in shaping population dynamics and carrying capacity. This may be particularly relevant for organisms where limitations on juvenile mobility cause maternal choice of breeding locations to influence the spatial distribution of younger life stages. 2. In this study, we mapped redd locations and the resulting densities of juveniles the following year along the entire reach (9{\textperiodcentered}2km) of a river holding natural populations of anadromous salmonids (Atlantic salmon and brown trout). These data were used to quantify the spatial scale over which breeding influences juvenile densities, and hence becomes important for density-dependent processes. 3. Although the observed cumulative distributions indicated a relatively uniform distribution of breeding along the river, autocorrelation analyses identified spatial patchiness of both breeding and resulting juveniles on a local scale. Furthermore, cross-correlations suggested a close spatial relationship between distribution of redds and juveniles. 4. Using spatially explicit hockey-stick stock-recruitment functions, we found juvenile salmonid density to be mostly influenced by the amount of breeding upstream of a given location. This influence decreased rapidly within the first 75-150 m. Thus, female choice with regard to breeding location gave rise to a heterogeneous distribution of offspring on a spatial scale of almost two orders of magnitude finer than that of the whole population (9{\textperiodcentered}2km). 5. The results are consistent with smaller scale experimental studies of salmonids, and emphasize the role for maternal choice of breeding locations in causing substantial spatial heterogeneity in juvenile densities within natural populations. Due to effects of density heterogeneity on overall levels of competition, this adds another layer of complexity to the dynamics of salmonid populations even in populations where breeding appears to be relatively uniformly distributed through space, and potentially also for a range of other organisms where juvenile dispersal is constrained. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors.

abstract = {1. Habitat degradation is seriously threatening stream biodiversity and productivity world-wide. For salmonid fish, restoration projects in disturbed systems commonly aim at increasing the availability of suitable breeding habitats, but expectations of effects on population abundance based on explicit models are lacking. 2. We used a spatial population model to predict how breeder dispersion may influence population dynamics of salmonids. Simulations involved changing the relative abundance of habitat suitable for two juvenile size classes (small fry and larger parr), the type of density-dependent regulation (effects on survival only vs. effects on survival and growth) and intercohort competitive mechanisms. 3. Increased breeding dispersion could alter patterns of density-dependent mortality and increase equilibrium adult abundance and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, there was a strong interaction between stage-specific habitat abundance and breeding dispersion. The most pronounced effects of breeding dispersion were observed under intermediate levels of fry habitat abundance. 4. When fry habitat was abundant, density-dependent mortality was most intense during the parr stage, and increased breeding dispersion did not increase adult abundance or MSY. In fact, when populations were regulated in the parr stage, increased breeding dispersion could cause decreased adult abundance because of the effects of intercohort competition. This negative effect only occurred, however, when competition among juveniles was symmetric (no age or size advantage). 5. Synthesis and applications. The population effects of restoring breeding habitat can differ among environments, and we have demonstrated how these differences can be understood in the light of stage-specific density dependence. Increasing spatial dispersion of breeders may often be an efficient measure for conserving threatened populations and increasing yields in fished populations. However, if direct evidence or habitat considerations suggest that fish populations experience density-dependent mortality during the parr stage, attempts to increase abundance through increased breeding distribution or artificial stocking should be avoided, as these are likely to be ineffective or even detrimental. The difference between fishing rates providing maximum sustainable yield and extinction is particularly small for such populations, suggesting that fish managers should adopt a conservative and flexible regulation regime. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of $\sim$100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10% surface area protection from the current 1.8%. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.},

abstract = {1 The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2 Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3 Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4 At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5 Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed. [References: 47] English Article},

abstract = {Monitoring natural populations is often a necessary step to establish the conservation status of species and to help improve management decisions. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs do not effectively address primary sources of variability in monitoring data, which ultimately may limit the utility of monitoring in identifying declines and improving management. To illustrate the importance of taking into account detectability and spatial variation, we used a recently proposed estimator of abundance (superpopulation estimator) to estimate population size of and number of young produced by the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) in Florida. During the last decade, primary recovery targets set by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Snail Kite that were based on deficient monitoring programs (i.e., uncorrected counts) were close to being met (by simply increasing search effort during count surveys). During that same period, the Snail Kite population declined dramatically (by 55% from 1997 to 2005) and the number of young decreased by 70% between 1992-1998 and 1999-2005. Our results provide a strong practical case in favor of the argument that investing a sufficient amount of time and resources into designing and implementing monitoring programs that carefully address detectability and spatial variation is critical for the conservation of endangered species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {1. The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations. 2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature. 3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities. 4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors.

abstract = {The SLOSS (single large or several small) debate is no longer an issue in the discussion about the optimal size of nature reserves. The best way to estimate the minimum sizes of reserves may be a three-step process: (1) identify target or keystone species whose disappearance would significantly decrease the value or species diversity of the reserve; (2) determine the minimum number of individuals in a population needed to guarantee a high probability of survival for these species; (3) using known densities, estimate the area needed to sustain the minimum number. The forces that affect population viability and determine MVPs (minimum viable populations) are extremely complex. Thoughtful estimates of MVPs for many animal species are rarely lower than an effective size of a few hundred. Attempts to save only common or smaller species in a community will usually be ill-fated because of the web of ecological relationships between species, including the importance of predation and herbivory in the maintenance of species diversity. Other topics discussed include the complementarity of conservation goals, the problematic function of corridors and the value of buffer zones. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.},

In this proposed modification, we synthesize the adequacy of the existing recovery criteria, show amended recovery criteria, and provide rationale supporting the proposed recovery plan modification. The proposed modification is shown as an addendum that supplements the South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan (MSRP; Service 1999) by adding delisting criteria for the SNKI that were not developed at the time this recovery plan was completed. The original recovery objectives and the step-down outline are described on pages 4-317-4-323 of the MSRP. For U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 4 Atlanta, Georgia March 2019 METHODOLOGY USED TO COMPLETE THE RECOVERY PLAN AMENDMENT These proposed amendments to the recovery criteria were developed using the most recent and best available information for the species. Primary sources of information included the most recent 5-year review (USFWS 2007) and the current recovery plan (USFWS 1999). This information was prepared by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) biologists and managers in the South Florida Ecological Services Field Office in order to develop the recovery criteria for the SNKI. ADEQUACY OF RECOVERY CRITERIA Section 4(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) requires that each recovery plan shall incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, "objective, measurable criteria which, when met, would result in a determination that the species be removed from the list." Legal challenges to recovery plans (see Fund for Animals v. Babbitt, 903 F. Supp. 96 (D.D.C. 1995)) and a Government Accountability Audit (GAO 2006) also have affirmed the need to frame recovery criteria in terms of threats assessed under the five listing factors.},

We analyzed spatial and temporal trends in shark bites on sea otters in California, assessing the frequency of shark bite wounds in 1,870 carcasses collected since 1985. The proportion of stranded sea otters having shark bites has increased sharply since 2003, and white shark bites now account for >50% of recovered carcasses. The trend was most pronounced in the southern part of the range, from Estero Bay to Point Conception, where shark bite frequency has increased eightfold. Seasonal trends were also evident: most shark-bitten carcasses are recovered in late summer and fall; however, the period of elevated shark bite frequency has lengthened. The causes of these trends are unclear, but possible contributing factors include increased white shark abundance and/or changes in white shark behavior and distribution. In particular, the spatiotemporal patterns of shark-bitten sea otters match increases in pinniped populations, and the increased availability of marine mammal prey for white sharks may have led to more sharks spending more time in nearshore waters utilized by both sea otters and pinnipeds.},

abstract = {Mixed-stock fisheries simultaneously exploit populations that may differ in their conservation status, and uncertainty in stock-specific harvest rates can hamper evaluations of recovery prospects for depressed populations. These difficulties are exemplified in the Sockeye Salmon population from the Atnarko watershed, which collapsed in the early 2000s, causing cultural and economic hardship. A recovery plan identified the incidental harvest of Sockeye Salmon by mixed-stock fisheries in the Atnarko as a potential, but poorly understood, impediment to recovery. We reconstructed harvest rates for salmon in Indigenous and commercial fisheries and used an age-structured state-space model of stock–recruit dynamics to predict how a range of future mixed-stock harvest rates would influence recovery. Under recent harvest rates, there is a 50–60% chance that the population will grow to exceed a recovery goal of 15,000 spawners over the next four generations. Eliminating the harvest of Sockeye Salmon altogether increased predicted recovery prospects to a maximum of 69%, suggesting that factors other than fisheries are contributing to the lack of recovery (e.g., ocean conditions) and that harvest management alone is unlikely to lead to recovery with a high degree of certainty. We developed a generalized migration, harvest, and catch monitoring simulation model to quantify how different monitoring scenarios might improve estimates for mixed-stock harvest rates. Increasing the number of specimens collected for genetic samples improved the harvest rate estimates for each stock caught in the mixed-stock fisheries, particularly for the smallest stocks, and relative to single sampling events conducted near the peak of the return migration, weekly sampling improved estimates only slightly but provided insurance against missing the peak of the return migration. Our study highlights collaborative research initiated and directed by the Nuxalk Nation to promote the recovery of a depressed stock that is inherent to traditional foods, thereby contributing to a global effort to integrate Indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

Mean (±SE) parr-to-smolt survival of the early migrating cohorts was 45.4 ± 6.3% (n = 13) compared with 37.4 ± 4.7% (n = 13) for later migrating cohorts. Annual mean parr-to-smolt survival differed widely across years ranging from a low of 9.6 ± 0.5% (n = 2) in 2001 to a high of 81.7 ± 4.6% (n = 2) in 1999. Parr growth prior to reservoir entry and reservoir velocity provided the most information on variability in parr-to-smolt survival (N = 26, R2 = 0.75, corrected Akaike's information criterion [AICc]=-5.01). We suggest that parr growth and reservoir velocity were directly proportional to parr-to-smolt survival because fast growth and downstream movement reduces the time when fish are vulnerable to predators. The effect of reservoir velocity comports with previous published studies and supports management efforts to increase reservoir velocity. Few if any published studies explicitly relate parr growth measured on individual fish to survival estimated for their cohorts in freshwater. This study provides empirical evidence that upholds the long-held belief that any anthropogenic activity that reduces growth of juvenile salmonids during freshwater rearing has the potential to reduce their survival.},

The proposal highlights a troubling blind spot in Canada's environmental decisionmaking. This gap could enable decisions that insufficiently consider risks to both environment and people. Science can help decrease these blind spots. The second-largest salmon producer in Canada, the Skeena River has supported First Nation fisheries for 5 millennia ([ 2 ][2]). Its estuary is a nursery for hundreds of millions of young salmon annually as they graduate from freshwater to sea ([ 2 ][2]). It is also situated between fossil fuel reserves in interior Canada and ocean-access to Asian markets. Multinational companies have proposed pipelines to and terminals in the estuary, and are currently assessing the environmental impacts on constitutionally protected ([ 3 ][3]) aboriginal fisheries. Previous research indicates that industrialized estuaries depress salmon survival ([ 4 ][4]). Although terminal proponents and the government have recognized interests of First Nations from the estuary during environmental assessment, they have ignored interests of upriver First Nations who also harvest salmon ([ 5 ][5]). Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers during their life. We have shown that the proposed development area supports particularly high abundances of juvenile salmon from more than 40 populations that are harvested in at least 10 First Nations territories throughout the Skeena watershed and beyond ([ 6 ][6], [ 7 ][7]). This is twice the number of First Nations groups that industry proponents identified as needing to be consulted ([ 5 ][5]). These data reveal a striking mismatch between the narrow consideration of aboriginal rights and environmental risks and the true scale of environmental connections, which needs to be addressed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and industrial proponents. The terminal application is being evaluated by CEAA without consideration of upriver First Nations ([ 5 ][5]). Moreover, despite the resounding rejection of the $1 billion by the estuary First Nation due to environmental and cultural concerns, the government has ratified fiscal agreements with terminal proponents ([ 8 ][8]).

abstract = {Natal homing is a hallmark of the life history of salmonid fishes, but the spatial scale of homing within local, naturally reproducing salmon populations is still poorly understood. Accurate homing (paired with restricted movement) should lead to the existence of fine-scale genetic structuring due to the spatial clustering of related individuals on spawning grounds. Thus, we explored the spatial resolution of natal homing using genetic associations among individual Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in an interconnected stream network. We also investigated the relationship between genetic patterns and two factors hypothesized to influence natal homing and localized movements at finer scales in this species, localized patterns in the distribution of spawning gravels and sex. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that spawning locations in both sub-basins of our study site were spatially clumped, but the upper sub-basin generally had a larger spatial extent and continuity of redd locations than the lower sub-basin, where the distribution of redds and associated habitat conditions were more patchy. Male genotypes were not autocorrelated at any spatial scale in either sub-basin. Female genotypes showed significant spatial autocorrelation and genetic patterns for females varied in the direction predicted between the two sub-basins, with much stronger autocorrelation in the sub-basin with less continuity in spawning gravels. The patterns observed here support predictions about differential constraints and breeding tactics between the two sexes and the potential for fine-scale habitat structure to influence the precision of natal homing and localized movements of individual Chinook salmon on their breeding grounds.},

These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries. Our findings illustrate how a deep historical perspective can expand our understanding of past abundances to a time before species incurred significant losses from fishing, and help inform conservation for diminished populations.},

abstract = {1.  Geostatistical data—spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon— are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.

2.  Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package's use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.

3.  We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).

4.  We hope that sdmTMB's user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.

abstract = {In the model described, we attempt to link breeding-site selection to population dynamics for situations in which there is more than one distinct type of habitat. The distribution of individuals between habitat types depends on the selective abilities of the species. This distribution, in turn, influences the population dynamics of the species as a whole. We show that the consequences of habitat selection on population dynamics for an ideal free distribution of individuals across habitats is predictably different from what would be predicted if habitat selection were preemptive, that is, if individuals, upon selecting a site, prevented others from sharing the site. If preemptive selection is ideal, average reproductive success declines with increasing density because each individual selects the best site available from those sites not yet occupied. The model allows us to compare the relative contribution of different types of habitats to a species' growth rate and population size. Furthermore, we can also predict how the loss of habitat of a particular type may affect a population. This should make the model useful for environmental management problems as well as for describing the present distribution of a species across a spatially heterogeneous landscape.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are quickly gaining popularity as a management option for marine conservation, fisheries, and other human uses of the oceans. Despite the popularity of marine reserves as a management tool, few reserves appear to have been created or designed with an understanding of how reserves affect biological factors or how reserves can be designed to meet biological goals more effectively (e.g., attaining sustainable fish populations). This shortcoming occurs in part because the many studies that have examined the impacts of reserves on marine organisms remain isolated examples or anecdotes; the results of these many studies have not yet been synthesized. Here, I review the empirical work and discuss the theoretical literature to assess the impacts of marine reserves on several biological measures (density, biomass, size of organisms, and diversity), paying particular attention to the role reserve size has in determining those impacts. The results of 89 separate studies show that, on average, with the exception of invertebrate biomass and size, values for all four biological measures are significantly higher inside reserves compared to outside (or after reserve establishment vs. before) when evaluated for both the overall communities and by each functional group within these communities (carnivorous fishes, herbivorous fishes, planktivorous fishes/invertebrate eaters, and invertebrates). Surprisingly, results also show that the relative impacts of reserves, such as the proportional differences in density or biomass, are independent of reserve size, suggesting that the effects of marine reserves increase directly rather than proportionally with the size of a reserve. However, equal relative differences in biological measures between small and large reserves nearly always translate into greater absolute differences for larger reserves, and so larger reserves may be necessary to meet the goals set for marine reserves.

The quality of the data in the reviewed studies varied greatly. To improve data quality in the future, whenever possible, studies should take measurements before and after the creation of a reserve, replicate sampling, and include a suite of representative species. Despite the variable quality of the data, the results from this review suggest that nearly any marine habitat can benefit from the implementation of a reserve. Success of a marine reserve, however, will always be judged against the expectations for that reserve, and so we must keep in mind the goals of a reserve in its design, management, and evaluation.},

abstract = {Density-dependent processes have repeatedly been shown to have a central role in salmonid population dynamics, but are often assumed to be negligible for populations at low abundances relative to historical records. Density dependence has been observed in overall spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha production, but it is not clear how patterns observed at the aggregate level relate to individual populations within the basin. We used a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to explore the degree of density dependence in juvenile production for nine Idaho populations. Our results indicate that density dependence is ubiquitous, although its strength varies between populations. We also investigated the processes driving the population-level pattern and found density-dependent growth and mortality present for both common life-history strategies, but no evidence of density-dependent movement. Overwinter mortality, spatial clustering of redds and limited resource availability were identified as potentially important limiting factors contributing to density dependence. The ubiquity of density dependence for these threatened populations is alarming as stability at present low abundance levels suggests recovery may be difficult without major changes. We conclude that density dependence at the population level is common and must be considered in demographic analysis and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

The "delisting" rule does not adequately address lack of genetic connectivity between Yellowstone wolf packs and other NRM populations, for which reason a federal court overturned the 2008 predecessor of the rule. The US Fish and Wildlife Service defies its own policies by delisting the Idaho and Montana portions of the DPS while Wyoming wolves remain endangered. Criteria for this delisting are inconsistent with prior delistings of recovered birds and mammals. New scientific understanding of species recovery argues for a higher delisting threshold for the NRM gray wolf metapopulation. Finally, we argue that ecosystem recovery should be a recovery criterion for this unique keystone predator. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological. Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most fisheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that fish are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that fish movement is such that local fishing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in fishing mortality, growth and recruitment are identified. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and fishery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on fishery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment configurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and final spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and final spawning biomass. Assessment configurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment configuration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and fishery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model configurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model specification.},

In the presence of a sink patch (simulated by a pulsed removal of immigrants), source-patch populations failed to increase over the breeding season, mainly due to a high spatially density-dependent dispersal rate from source to sink patches. The <i>per capita</i> recruitment rate was almost two times higher in source-sink than in the source-source system, but this did not compensate for the loss rate due to dispersal from source to sink patches. Sex ratio in the source-sink systems became less female biased, probably a result of an enhanced frequency of dispersal movements in femals.

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ?functional landscape heterogeneity?. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Keywords},

Patterns of habitat patch occupancy and local density in the three species support the general predictions of metapopulation models. We develop a spatially explicit metapopulation model and fit it to data on the three species. The model is tested with independent data on H. comma and P. argus, for which it predicts the rate and pattern of spread into networks of vacant habitat patches following introduction or natural recolonization. The model can be used to assess the potential of specific networks of habitat patches to support viable metapopulations of given species, and it therefore has great potential value for conservation of butterflies and other species which occur as systems of interconnected small populations. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Here, we determine the influence of river network structure on the stability of riverine metapopulations. We introduce an approach that converts river networks to metapopulation networks, and analytically show how fluctuation magnitude is influenced by interaction structure. We show that river metapopulation complexity (in terms of branching prevalence) has nonlinear dampening effects on population fluctuations, and can also buffer against synchronisation. We conclude by showing that river transects generally increase synchronisation, while the spatial scale of interaction has nonlinear effects on synchronised dynamics. Our results indicate that this dual stability - conferred by fluctuation and synchronisation dampening - emerges from interaction structure in rivers, and this may strongly influence the persistence of river metapopulations.},

However, estimating recruitment in a stock assessment model involves the challenging task of identifying a self-sustaining population, which often includes representing complex geographic structure. A review of several case studies demonstrated that alternative stock assessment models can influence estimates of recruitment. Incorporating spatial population structure and connectivity into stock assessment models changed the perception of recruitment events for a wide diversity of fisheries, but the degree to which estimates were impacted depended on movement rates and relative stock sizes. For multiple population components, estimates of strong recruitment events and the productivity of smaller population units were often more sensitive to connectivity assumptions. Simulation testing, conditioned on these case studies, suggested that accurately accounting for population structure, either in management unit definitions or stock assessment model structure, improved recruitment estimates. An understanding of movement dynamics improved estimation of connected sub-populations. The challenge of representing geographic structure in stock assessment emphasizes the importance of defining self-sustaining management units to justify a unit-stock assumption.},

Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

The forces that affect population viability and determine MVPs (minimum viable populations) are extremely complex. Thoughtful estimates of MVPs for many animal species are rarely lower than an effective size of a few hundred. Attempts to save only common or smaller species in a community will usually be ill-fated because of the web of ecological relationships between species, including the importance of predation and herbivory in the maintenance of species diversity.

While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner-recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner-recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Scale transition theory is an approach to understanding population and community dynamics in the presence of spatial or temporal variation in environmental factors or population densities. It focuses on changes in the equations for population dynamics as the scale enlarges. These changes are explained in terms of interactions between nonlinearities and variation on lower scales, and they predict the emergence of new properties on larger scales that are not predicted by lower scale dynamics in the absence of variation on those lower scales. These phenomena can be understood in terms of statistical inequalities arising from the process of nonlinear averaging, which translates the rules for dynamics from lower to higher scales. Nonlinearities in population dynamics are expressions of the fundamental biology of the interactions between individual organisms. Variation that interacts with these nonlinearities also involves biology fundamentally in several different ways. First, there are the aspects of biology that are sensitive to variation in space or time. These determine which aspects of a nonlinear dynamical equation are affected by variation, and whether different individuals or different species are sensitive to different extents or to different aspects of variation. Second is the nature of the variation, for example, whether it is variation in the physical environment or variation in population densities. From the interplay between variation and nonlinearities in population dynamics, scale transition theory builds a theory of changes in dynamics with changes in scale. In this article, the focus is on spatial variation, and the theory is illustrated with examples relevant to the dynamics of insect communities. In these communities, one commonly occurring nonlinear relationship is a negative exponential relationship between survival of an organism and the densities of natural enemies or competitors. This negative exponential has a biological origin in terms of independent actions of many individuals. The subsequent effects of spatial variation can be represented naturally in terms of Laplace transforms and related statistical transforms to obtain both analytical solutions and an extra level of understanding. This process allows us to analyze the meaning and effects of aggregation of insects in space. Scale transition theory more generally, however, does not aim to have fully analytical solutions but partial analytical solutions applicable for circumstances too complex for full analytical solution. These partial solutions are intended to provide a framework for understanding of numerical solutions, simulations and field studies where key quantities can be estimated from empirical data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Oil and gas interests and the government recently offered a First Nation in the Skeena River estuary (BC, Canada) $1 billion to consent to construction of a controversial terminal to load fossil fuels onto tankers ([ 1 ][1]). The proposal highlights a troubling blind spot in Canada's environmental decisionmaking. This gap could enable decisions that insufficiently consider risks to both environment and people. Science can help decrease these blind spots. The second-largest salmon producer in Canada, the Skeena River has supported First Nation fisheries for 5 millennia ([ 2 ][2]). Its estuary is a nursery for hundreds of millions of young salmon annually as they graduate from freshwater to sea ([ 2 ][2]). It is also situated between fossil fuel reserves in interior Canada and ocean-access to Asian markets. Multinational companies have proposed pipelines to and terminals in the estuary, and are currently assessing the environmental impacts on constitutionally protected ([ 3 ][3]) aboriginal fisheries. Previous research indicates that industrialized estuaries depress salmon survival ([ 4 ][4]). Although terminal proponents and the government have recognized interests of First Nations from the estuary during environmental assessment, they have ignored interests of upriver First Nations who also harvest salmon ([ 5 ][5]). Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers during their life. We have shown that the proposed development area supports particularly high abundances of juvenile salmon from more than 40 populations that are harvested in at least 10 First Nations territories throughout the Skeena watershed and beyond ([ 6 ][6], [ 7 ][7]). This is twice the number of First Nations groups that industry proponents identified as needing to be consulted ([ 5 ][5]). These data reveal a striking mismatch between the narrow consideration of aboriginal rights and environmental risks and the true scale of environmental connections, which needs to be addressed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and industrial proponents. The terminal application is being evaluated by CEAA without consideration of upriver First Nations ([ 5 ][5]). Moreover, despite the resounding rejection of the $1 billion by the estuary First Nation due to environmental and cultural concerns, the government has ratified fiscal agreements with terminal proponents ([ 8 ][8]).

abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to reevaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data syntheses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools.},

abstract = {The recovery of large carnivore species from over-exploitation can have socioecological effects; thus, reliable estimates of potential abundance and distribution represent a valuable tool for developing management objectives and recovery criteria. For sea otters (Enhydra lutris), as with many apex predators, equilibrium abundance is not constant across space but rather varies as a function of local habitat quality and resource dynamics, thereby complicating the extrapolation of carrying capacity (K) from one location to another. To overcome this challenge, we developed a state-space model of density-dependent population dynamics in southern sea otters (E. l. nereis), in which K is estimated as a continuously varying function of a suite of physical, biotic, and oceanographic variables, all described at fine spatial scales. We used a theta-logistic process model that included environmental stochasticity and allowed for density-independent mortality associated with shark bites. We used Bayesian methods to fit the model to time series of survey data, augmented by auxiliary data on cause of death in stranded otters. Our model results showed that the expected density at K for a given area can be predicted based on local bathymetry (depth and distance from shore), benthic substrate composition (rocky vs. soft sediments), presence of kelp canopy, net primary productivity, and whether or not the area is inside an estuary. In addition to density-dependent reductions in growth, increased levels of shark-bite mortality over the last decade have also acted to limit population expansion. We used the functional relationships between habitat variables and equilibrium density to project estimated values of K for the entire historical range of southern sea otters in California, USA, accounting for spatial variation in habitat quality. Our results suggest that California could eventually support 17,226 otters (95% CrI = 9,739–30,087). We also used the fitted model to compute candidate values of optimal sustainable population abundance (OSP) for all of California and for regions within California. We employed a simulation-based approach to determine the abundance associated with the maximum net productivity level (MNPL) and propose that the upper quartile of the distribution of MNPL estimates (accounting for parameter uncertainty) represents an appropriate threshold value for OSP. Based on this analysis, we suggest a candidate value for OSP (for all of California) of 10,236, which represents 59.4% of projected K. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {Movement is important for ecological and evolutionary theory as well as connectivity conservation, which is increasingly critical for species responding to environmental change. Key ecological and evolutionary outcomes of movement, such as population growth and gene flow, require effective dispersal: movement that is followed by successful reproduction. However, the relative roles of movement and postmovement reproduction for effective dispersal and connectivity remain unclear. Here we isolate the contributions of movement and immigrant reproduction to effective dispersal and connectivity across the entire breeding range of an endangered raptor, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). To do so, we unite mark-resight data on movement and reproduction across 9 years and 27 breeding patches with an integrated model that decomposes effective dispersal into its hierarchical levels of movement, postmovement breeding attempt, and postmovement reproductive success. We found that immigrant reproduction limits effective dispersal more than movement for this endangered species, demonstrating that even highly mobile species may have limited effective connectivity due to reduced immigrant reproduction. We found different environmental limitations for the reproductive component of effective dispersal compared with movement, indicating that different conservation strategies may be needed when promoting effective dispersal rather than movement alone. We also demonstrate that considering immigrant reproduction, rather than movement alone, alters which patches are the most essential for connectivity, thereby changing conservation priorities. These results challenge the assumption that understanding movement alone is sufficient to infer connectivity and highlight that connectivity conservation may require not only fostering movement but also successful reproduction of immigrants.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists often ignore density dependence because at-risk populations are typically small relative to historical levels. However, if populations are reduced as a result of impacts that lower carrying capacity, then density-dependent mortality may exist at low population abundances. Here, we explore this issue in threatened populations of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We followed the fate of more than 50 000 juvenile chinook in the Snake River Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that their survival was inversely associated with juvenile density. We also tested the hypotheses that non-indigenous brook trout and habitat quality affect the presence or strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that juvenile chinook suffer density-dependent mortality and the strength of density dependence was greater in streams in which brook trout were absent. We were unable to detect an effect of habitat quality on the strength of density dependence. Historical impacts of humans have greatly reduced population sizes of salmon, and the density dependence we report may stem from a shortage of nutrients normally derived from decomposing salmon carcasses. Cohorts of juvenile salmon may experience density-dependent mortality at population sizes far below historical levels and recovery of imperiled populations may be much slower than currently expected.},

abstract = {Sea otter populations in Southeast Alaska, USA, have increased dramatically from just over 400 translocated animals in the late 1960s to >8,000 by 2003. The recovery of sea otters to ecosystems from which they had been absent has affected coastal food webs, including commercially important fisheries, and thus information on expected growth and equilibrium abundances can help inform resource management. We compile available survey data for Southeast Alaska and fit a Bayesian state-space model to estimate past trends and current abundance. Our model improves upon previous analyses by partitioning and quantifying sources of estimation error, accounting for over-dispersion of aerial count data, and providing realistic measurements of uncertainty around point estimates of abundance at multiple spatial scales. We also provide estimates of carrying capacity (K) for Southeast Alaska, at regional and sub-regional scales, and analyze growth rates, current population status and expected future trends. At the regional scale, the population increased from 13,221 otters in 2003 to 25,584 otters in 2011. The average annual growth rate in southern Southeast Alaska (7.8%) was higher than northern Southeast Alaska (2.7%); however, growth varied at the sub-regional scale and there was a negative relationship between growth rates and the number of years sea otters were present in an area. Local populations vary in terms of current densities and expected future growth; the mean estimated density at K was 4.2 ± 1.58 sea otters/km2 of habitat (i.e., the sub-tidal benthos between 0 m and 40 m depth) and current densities correspond on average to 50% of projected equilibrium values (range = 1–97%) with the earliest-colonized sub-regions tending to be closer to K. Assuming a similar range of equilibrium densities for currently un-occupied habitats, the projected value of K for all of Southeast Alaska is 74,650 sea otters. Future analyses can improve upon the precision of K estimates by employing more frequent surveys at index sites and incorporating environmental covariates into the process model to generate more accurate, location-specific estimates of equilibrium density. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3% of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6%, the mixed hypothesis 30.5%, and the random hypothesis 12.6%.

We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales.

abstract = {Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.},

abstract = {Management of spatially structured species poses unique challenges. Despite a strong theoretical foundation, practitioners rarely have sufficient empirical data to evaluate how populations interact. Rather, assumptions about connectivity and source–sink dynamics are often based on incomplete, extrapolated, or modeled data, if such interactions are even considered at all. Therefore, it has been difficult to evaluate whether spatially structured species are meeting conservation goals. We evaluated how estimated metapopulation structure responded to estimates of population sizes and dispersal probabilities and to the set of populations included. We then compared outcomes of alternative management strategies that target conservation of metapopulation processes. We illustrated these concepts for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River, USA. Our description of spatial structure for this metapopulation was consistent with previous characterizations. We found substantial differences in estimated metapopulation structure when we had incomplete information about all populations and when we used different sources of data (three empirical, two modeled) to estimate dispersal, whereas responses to population size estimates were more consistent. Together, these findings suggest that monitoring efforts should target all populations occasionally and populations that play key roles frequently and that multiple types of data should be collected when feasible. When empirical data are incomplete or of uneven quality, analyses using estimates produced from an ensemble of available datasets can help conservation planners and managers weigh near-term options. Doing so, we found trade-offs in connectivity and source dominance in metapopulation-level responses to alternative management strategies that suggest which types of approaches may be inherently less risky.},

We have compiled such a data set by georeferencing the network-scale distribution of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) redds across a large wilderness basin (7330 km2) in central Idaho for 9 years (1995–2003). During this time, the population grew at a rate of 5.3 recruits per spawner, and redd numbers increased from 20 to 2271. As abundances increased, fish expanded into portions of the stream network that had recently been unoccupied. Even at the highest escapements, however, distributions remained clustered, and a limited portion of the network contained the majority of redds. The importance of the highest density spawning areas was greatest when abundances were low, suggesting these areas may serve as refugia during demo- graphic bottlenecks. Analysis of variance indicated that redd numbers were strongly affected by local habitats and broad climatic controls, but also revealed a space–time interaction that suggested temporal instability in spatial patterns. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining habitats with high densities of individuals, but also suggest that broader views may be needed to accommodate the dynamics of natural salmonid populations.

abstract = {Natural disturbances and habitat degradation are major factors influencing the dynamics and persistence of many wildlife populations, yet few large-scale studies have explored the relative influence of these factors on the dynamics and persistence of animal populations. We used longterm demographic data and matrix population models to examine the potential effects of habitat degradation and natural disturbances on the dynamics of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. We found that estimates of stochastic population growth rate were low (0.90). Population growth rate ($\lambda$) during the first half or our study period (1992 to 1998) was substantially greater than during the second half (1999 to 2005). These 2 periods were characterized by contrasting hydrological conditions. Although $\lambda$ was most sensitive to changes in adult survival, the analysis of life table response experiments revealed that a reduction in fertility of kites accounted for >80% of the observed decline in population growth rate. We examined the possibility that the reduction in $\lambda$ was caused by (1) habitat degradation due to management, (2) an increase in frequency of moderate drying events in recent years, and (3) both habitat degradation and an increase in frequency of moderate drying events. Our results suggest that both factors could potentially contribute to a large decrease in population growth rate. Our study highlights the importance of simultaneously considering short- and long-term effects of disturbances when modeling population dynamics. Indeed, focusing exclusively on one type of effect may be misleading to both our understanding of the ecological dynamics of the system and to management. The relevance of our results to management is heightened because the snail kite has been selected as a key performance measure of one of the most ambitious ecosystem restoration projects ever undertaken. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary causes of dispersal can be crucial in understanding the behaviour of spatially structured populations, and predicting how species respond to environmental change. Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term ‚{\"{A}}{\`{o}}dispersal‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}, for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.},

Fifteen of 19 populations showed evidence of a significant decrease in growth rate with increasing density. In 11 of these 15 populations, the pattern of density-dependent growth was better described by a negative power curve than by a linear regression (i.e. Akaike Information Criterion, AIClinear - AICpower > 2), whereas only one population was better described by a linear regression than by a negative power curve; three populations were adequately described by both models (AIC < 2). In 10 of the 11 populations that were best described by a negative power curve, most of the decrease in growth rate occurred at population densities <1 fish m-2, when space limitation is unlikely. This analysis provides broad support for the hypothesis that density-dependent growth in stream salmonids occurs primarily at low population densities, probably due to exploitative competition. {\textcopyright} The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, 2005.},

abstract = {Understanding dispersal and habitat selection behaviours is central to many problems in ecology, evolution and conservation. One factor often hypothesized to influence habitat selection by dispersers is the natal environment experienced by juveniles. Nonetheless, evidence for the effect of natal environment on dispersing, wild vertebrates remains limited. Using 18 years of nesting and mark-resight data across an entire North American geographical range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), we tested for natal effects on breeding-site selection by dispersers and its consequences for reproductive success and population structure. Dispersing snail kites were more likely to nest in wetlands of the same habitat type (lacustrine or palustrine) as their natal wetland, independent of dispersal distance, but this preference declined with age and if individuals were born during droughts. Importantly, dispersing kites that bred in natal-like habitats had lower nest success and productivity than kites that did not. These behaviours help explain recently described population connectivity and spatial structure across their geographical range and reveal that assortative breeding is occurring, where birds are more likely to breed with individuals born in the same wetland type as their natal habitat. Natal environments can thus have long-term and large-scale effects on populations in nature, even in highly mobile animals.},

abstract = {Many juvenile salmon and trout migrated from the Lemhi River drainage each fall-winter-spring period. Seaward migration of anadromous trout and salmon normally occurred in the spring but pre-smolt anadromous and non-anadromous fishes also left the stream usually beginning in the fall. I compared data on temperature, food abundance, stream flow, cover and population density with movements and conducted field and laboratory tests to determine reasons for the two types of movements. Smolts of the anadromous species migrated for an obvious reason but none of the factors I examined appeared to “stimulate or release” their seaward migration. Movement frequently coincided with changes in water temperature and stream flow, but I could not establish a consistent causal relationship and concluded that photoperiod and perhaps growth must initiate the physiological and behavioral changes associated with seaward migration. Non-anadromous and pre-smolt anadromous species emigrated from the streams for different reasons than the smolts. I postulated that fish found the stream environment unsuitable during the winter. Stream temperature declined in the fall as fish began moving from the streams but I could not induce more fish to stay in test troughs with 12 C water versus troughs with 0–10 C water. Fish emigrated before abundance of drift insects declined in winter. Emigration occurred in spite of the relatively stable flows in both streams. Population density modified the basic migration pattern by regulating the number and percentage of fish that emigrated and to a limited extent time of emigration. Movements of non-smolt trout and salmon correlated best with the amount of cover provided by large rubble substrate. Subyearling trout emigrated from Big Springs Creek which contained no rubble substrate but remained in the Lemhi River which did. In both field and laboratory tests more fish remained in troughs or stream sections with large rubble substrate than in troughs or sections with gravel substrate. Trout and salmon in many Idaho streams enter the substrate when stream temperatures declined to 4–6 C. A suitable substrate providing adequate interstices appears necessary or the fish leave.},

The bioeconomic system is depicted with a metapopulation model where the subpopulations are connected by dispersal processes and are affected by the spatial distribution of harvesting effort. We characterize the optimal way to distribute harvesting effort over space and time in order to optimize returns from this spatial/dynamic system. We also investigate how the optimal spatial allocation of effort, harvesting, and biomass compare with second-best allocations that ignore spatial processes in this system. We find that optimal instruments reflect the interplay between the spatial gradient of rents and the spatial gradient of biological dispersal. Using a simple parameterization to explore qualitative properties in several specific examples, we find that second-best solutions blend or average results of the differentiated case and differ in intuitive ways from first-best optima. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents a model of renewable resource exploitation that incorporates both intertemporal dynamics and spatial movement. The model combines the H. S. Gordon-Vernon Smith hypothesis of a rent dissipation process with Ricardian notions that resources are exploited across space in a pattern dependent upon relative profitabilities. The population structure is characterized in a manner consistent with modern biological ideas that stress patchiness, heterogeneity, and interconnections among and between patches. Generally, we find the equilibrium patterns of biomass and effort across the system to be dependent upon bioeconomic conditions within each patch and the nature of the biological dispersal mechanism between patches. We use simple examples to illustrate how the distribution of effort throughout the system reflects the heterogeneity and the spatial biological linkages.},

We focused on the hypotheses that increased movement probabilities were in response to low food availability or low water levels; the latter also implying low food availability for this species. An alternative hypothesis was that snail kites exhibit exploratory behavior, and corresponding increased movement probabilities, during periods of high food availability. Movement probabilities were not consistent with the hypotheses that low water levels or low food availability were the proximate cues to initiate movement from one wetland to another. Movement probabilities were higher during periods of relatively high food availability and were not associated with water levels; thus were consistent with the hypothesis that snail kites exhibited exploratory behavior during times of food abundance. However, we do not believe that our results are in conflict with previous reports of increased movement during extreme food scarcity; rather, that these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and reflect different resource levels. During extreme drying events, food becomes virtually unavailable and birds must either move or die, but during times of food abundance there may be an advantage of exploratory behavior. Given that local drying events occur at frequencies of approximately every 5-10 yr in this environment, having explored wetlands throughout their range reduces the need for "blind" searching for suitable alternative habitats when such events do occur.},

abstract = {In marine populations, spatial structure arises over a wide range of scales and forms hierarchical aggregations. Changing spatial structure can alter the demographic and life history trait variation within populations and subject individuals to both novel environmental conditions and interspecific interactions. Thus, changes in the spatial structure of marine populations can be a prelude to further changes in abundance and can affect the resilience and recovery potential of populations following anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. These observations under - score the importance of studying the spatial ecology of marine fish populations in order to (1) understand the underlying mechanisms that can lead to rapid alterations in population abundance and community interactions, (2) provide indicators of stock health, and (3) characterize the consequences of changing spatial patterns on population susceptibility to exploitation and environmental variability. Here, we synthesize the interacting factors that influence the formation, maintenance and erosion of spatial structure in marine fish populations and identify the further con sequences of such erosion at the population and community levels. We emphasize human driven changes of population spatial structure for 3 levels of population genetic aggregation that are common in fisheries management scenarios, namely sympatric populations, metapopulations and panmictic populations. Case studies are presented for each level of aggregation. Throughout our review, we both summarize the factors that link spatial and temporal dynamics in marine populations and highlight the management and conservation implications of such linkages. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract = {An enduring challenge for ecology is identifying the drivers of ecosystem and population stability. In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system's response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.},

@article{Ricker1958,
abstract = {Using numerical models, effects of environmental variability upon yield were tested for six single-age fish stocks characterized by different kinds and degrees of density-dependent reproduction potential. The two levels of variability examined had extremes of yield standing in the ratios 7:1 and 18:1, respectively. Close regulation of fishing to the optimum percentage for each year's stock improves the long-term average catch taken, the improvement being the greater, the more variable the environment. With the higher level of variability, improvement in average catch among five of the stocks ranged from 26% to 79% increase. However this increase in mean catch is achieved at the expense of increased variability in catch from year to year—in fact, for some kinds of stocks there must be complete cessation of fishing in some years in order to get the long-term maximum. The yield of stocks, in which reproduction per spawner declines at low levels of abundance, is particularly improved by a close adaptation of fishing effort to the supply of fish available.When two or more populations of a species, characterized by different reproduction potentials, are fished in common, total potential catch is less than when each can be fished separately at its optimum level. If a common fishery cannot be avoided, the achievement of maximum average yield may find one of two originally-equal stocks as abundant or even more abundant than before the fishery began, while the other may persist only at a low level or even be exterminated completely.},

@article{Letessier2019,
abstract = {Since the 1950s, industrial fisheries have expanded globally, as fishing vessels are required to travel further afield for fishing opportunities. Technological advancements and fishery subsidies have granted ever-increasing access to populations of sharks, tunas, billfishes, and other predators. Wilderness refuges, defined here as areas beyond the detectable range of human influence, are therefore increasingly rare. In order to achieve marine resources sustainability, large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) with pelagic components are being implemented. However, such conservation efforts require knowledge of the critical habitats for predators, both across shallow reefs and the deeper ocean. Here, we fill this gap in knowledge across the Indo-Pacific by using 1,041 midwater baited videos to survey sharks and other pelagic predators such as rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata), mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus), and black marlin (Istiompax indica). We modeled three key predator community attributes: vertebrate species richness, mean maximum body size, and shark abundance as a function of geomorphology, environmental conditions, and human pressures. All attributes were primarily driven by geomorphology (35%−62% variance explained) and environmental conditions (14%−49%). While human pressures had no influence on species richness, both body size and shark abundance responded strongly to distance to human markets (12%−20%). Refuges were identified at more than 1,250 km from human markets for body size and for shark abundance. These refuges were identified as remote and shallow seabed features, such as seamounts, submerged banks, and reefs. Worryingly, hotpots of large individuals and of shark abundance are presently under-represented within no-take MPAs that aim to effectively protect marine predators, such as the British Indian Ocean Territory. Population recovery of predators is unlikely to occur without strategic placement and effective enforcement of large no-take MPAs in both coastal and remote locations.},

@article{Fryxell2001,
abstract = {1. Theory suggests that territorial species should share many of the same dynamical characteristics as metapopulations, including asynchronous local dynamics, potential for stochastic extinction of the population when rates of successful dispersal fall below mortality risk, and critical importance of the ratio of suitable to unsuitable habitat for long-term persistence. These propositions were tested on a population of beavers (Castor canadensis Kuhl) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, which has been continuously monitored over 11 years. 2. Results showed that the total population was considerably less variable than local abundance at 14 beaver colonies, due to asynchrony among local populations. This suggests that local ecological interactions were more important in determining year-to-year variation in beaver numbers than broad-scale environmental processes, such as weather. 3. Of the local colonies, 20% were never abandoned over ii years, although there was considerable turnover among adults. Offspring production exceeded adult abundance at five source colonies, which did not quite compensate for negative net production at nine sink colonies. These observations were consistent with predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality incorporating local variation in habitat suitability. Mean colony size and probability of recurrence from year-to-year were associated with local food availability, indicating that trophic interactions were important in determining local population dynamics. 4. The beaver population in Algonquin declined steadily over the study period, however, suggesting that spatial and demographic processes were insufficient to stabilize abundance over time. This is consistent with predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality in which suitable and unsuitable habitats are interspersed. It is hypothesized that long-term decline in habitat suitability is induced by acceleration of woody plant succession due to selective foraging by beavers.},

abstract = {Catch-age analysis has become a standard tool for modern stock assessment, where it is recognized that population estimates are linked to estimates of the natural mortality rate M. We use state space models and simulation–estimation cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In particular, we design a simulation model with realistic measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from an estimation model simplified to conform with common assumptions. We describe circumstances in which, simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The variance ratio $\rho$ relating process error in recruitments with measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for $\rho$. In general, estimation models perform better when the true $\rho$ is specified and measurement error is low, so that recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability. Thus, well-designed data collection programs are critical to the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

abstract = {The association among anthropogenic environmental disturbance, pathogen pollution and the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife has been postulated, but not always well supported by epidemiologic data. Specific evidence of coastal contamination of the marine ecosystem with the zoonotic protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, and extensive infection of southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) along the California coast was documented by this study. To investigate the extent of exposure and factors contributing to the apparent emergence of T. gondii in southern sea otters, we compiled environmental, demographic and serological data from 223 live and dead sea otters examined between 1997 and 2001. The T. gondii seroprevalence was 42% (49/116) for live otters, and 62% (66/107) for dead otters. Demographic and environmental data were examined for associations with T. gondii seropositivity, with the ultimate goal of identifying spatial clusters and demographic and environmental risk factors for T. gondii infection. Spatial analysis revealed clusters of T. gondii-seropositive sea otters at two locations along the coast, and one site with lower than expected T. gondii seroprevalence. Risk factors that were positively associated with T. gondii seropositivity in logistic regression analysis included male gender, older age and otters sampled from the Morro Bay region of California. Most importantly, otters sampled near areas of maximal freshwater runoff were approximately three times more likely to be seropositive to T. gondii than otters sampled in areas of low flow. No association was found between seropositivity to T. gondii and human population density or exposure to sewage. This study provides evidence implicating land-based surface runoff as a source of T. gondii infection for marine mammals, specifically sea otters, and provides a convincing illustration of pathogen pollution in the marine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The replacement of native species by nonnative species has been widely documented. In aquatic ecosystems, nonnative trout often replace native trout species to which they are closely related. For example, nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis have replaced native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii throughout western North America. We hypothesized that when brook trout replace cutthroat trout, they exhibit greater density, biomass, and annual production than were achieved by the cutthroat trout before replacement. We tested this hypothesis in five paired streams in the Teton River drainage, Idaho, over a 4-year period. Streams were paired based on similar habitat characteristics and the presence of brook trout or cutthroat trout as the dominant species. Fish were surveyed annually by means of multipass depletion along representative stream reaches. Consistent with our hypothesis, brook trout exhibited 2.4 times greater density, 1.7 times greater biomass, and 2.5 times higher annual production than cutthroat trout. Because age-0 fish were difficult to capture during electrofishing, we also analyzed the data without this age-class. When age-0 fish were excluded, brook trout exhibited 1.3, 1.6, and 2.1 times greater density, biomass, and annual production, respectively, than cutthrout trout. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nonnative salmonines exhibit greater density and production than the native fishes they replace, though the generality of this finding remains to be tested. The differences that we observed not only testify to the success of brook trout as an introduced species in western North America but also point to likely changes in ecosystem function that may accompany their replacement of native cutthroat trout.},

We evaluated anthropogenic effects on spatial connections among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) (designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) in the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. For several anthropogenic-effects scenarios, we used graph theory to characterize the spatial relation among populations. We plotted variance in population size against connectivity among populations. In our scenarios, reduced habitat quality decreased the size of populations and hydropower dams on rivers led to the extirpation of several populations, both of which decreased connectivity. Operation of fish hatcheries increased connectivity among populations and led to patchy or panmictic populations. On the basis of our results, we believe recolonization of the upper Cowlitz River by fall and spring Chinook and winter steelhead would best restore metapopulation structure to near-historical conditions. Extant populations that would best conserve connectivity would be those inhabiting the Molalla (spring Chinook), lower Cowlitz, or Clackamas (fall Chinook) rivers and the south Santiam (winter steelhead) and north fork Lewis rivers (summer steelhead). Populations in these rivers were putative sources; however, they were not always the most abundant or centrally located populations. This result would not have been obvious if we had not considered relations among populations in a metapopulation context. Our results suggest that dispersal rate strongly controls interactions among the populations that comprise salmon metapopulations. Thus, monitoring efforts could lead to understanding of the true rates at which wild and hatchery fish disperse. Our application of graph theory allowed us to visualize how metapopulation structure might respond to human activity. The method could be easily extended to evaluations of anthropogenic effects on other stream-dwelling populations and communities and could help prioritize among competing conservation measures.},

abstract = {Abstract To develop a habitat restoration strategy for the 8,270-km2 Skagit River basin, we estimated changes in smolt production of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch since European settlement began in the basin, based on changes in summer and winter rearing habitat areas. We assessed changes in coho salmon smolt production by habitat type and by cause of habitat alteration. We estimated that the coho salmon smolt production capacity of summer habitats in the Skagit River basin has been reduced from 1.28 million smolts to 0.98 million smolts (–24%) and that the production capacity of winter habitats has been reduced from 1.77 million to 1.17 million smolts (–34%). The largest proportion of summer non-main-stem habitat losses has occurred in side-channel sloughs (41%), followed by losses in small tributaries (31%) and distributary sloughs (29%). The largest loss of winter habitats has occurred in side-channel sloughs (52%), followed by losses in distributary sloughs (37%) and small tributaries (11%). By type of impact, hydromodification (diking, ditching, dredging) associated with agricultural and urban lands accounts for 73% of summer habitat losses and 91% of winter habitat losses. Blocking culverts on small tributaries account for 13% of the decrease in summer habitat and 6% of the decrease in winter habitat. Forestry activities account for 9% of summer habitat losses and 3% of winter habitat losses. Limitations of the analysis and implications for developing a habitat restoration strategy are discussed.},

abstract = {Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in conservation and population biology, but the standard approach has also been criticized for being too restrictive, as it is based on the effects of habitat patch area and isolation only. Here we demonstrate how the effects of habitat quality (extra environmental factors) and detailed landscape structure (described with GIS [Geographical Information System]) can be included in a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. Expanded models are tested with a large data set on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). The incidence function model supplemented with additional environmental factors revealed some new and confirmed some previously known interactions between M. cinxia and its environment. However, the ability of the additional environmental factors to explain the error in the fit of the basic model was generally low (less than or equal to 15%). In the second variant of the basic model, landscape structure was used to modify effective patch isolations. This approach, though biologically appealing, failed to improve significantly the fit of the incidence function model. There are several possible reasons for this failure, including inaccurate satellite data, problems with habitat classification, and most importantly, generic problems in the modeling of migration. Our results demonstrate that additional complexity beyond the effects of habitat patch area and isolation does not necessarily improve the predictive power of a metapopulation model.},

abstract = {Salmon are inherently resilient species. However, this resiliency has been undermined in British Columbia by a century of centralized, command-and-control management focused initially on maximizing yield and, more recently, on economic efficiency. Community and cultural resiliency have also been undermined, especially by the recent emphasis on economic efficiency, which has concentrated access in the hands of a few and has disenfranchised fishery-dependent communities. Recent declines in both salmon stocks and salmon prices have revealed the systemic failure of the current management system. If salmon and their fisheries are to become viable again, radically new management policies are needed. For the salmon species, the emphasis must shift from maximizing yield to restoring resilience; for salmon fisheries, the emphasis must shift from maximizing economic efficiency to maximizing community and cultural resilience. For the species, an approach is needed that integrates harvest management, habitat management, and habitat enhancement to sustain and enhance resilience. This is best achieved by giving fishing and aboriginal communities greater responsibility and authority to manage the fisheries on which they depend. Co-management arrangements that involve cooperative ownership of major multistock resources like the Fraser River and Skeena River fisheries and community-based quota management of smaller fisheries provide ways to put species conservation much more directly in the hands of the communities most dependent on the well-being and resilience of these fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the author(s).},

abstract = {Spatially continuous sampling designs, when temporally replicated, provide analytical flexibility and are unmatched in their ability to provide a dynamic system view. We have compiled such a data set by georeferencing the network-scale distribution of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) redds across a large wilderness basin (7330 km2) in central Idaho for 9 years (1995–2003). During this time, the population grew at a rate of 5.3 recruits per spawner, and redd numbers increased from 20 to 2271. As abundances increased, fish expanded into portions of the stream network that had recently been unoccupied. Even at the highest escapements, however, distributions remained clustered, and a limited portion of the network contained the majority of redds. The importance of the highest density spawning areas was greatest when abundances were low, suggesting these areas may serve as refugia during demo- graphic bottlenecks. Analysis of variance indicated that redd numbers were strongly affected by local habitats and broad climatic controls, but also revealed a space–time interaction that suggested temporal instability in spatial patterns. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining habitats with high densities of individuals, but also suggest that broader views may be needed to accommodate the dynamics of natural salmonid populations.

abstract = {Continuity of coastal Indigenous cultures relies on healthy ecosystems and opportunity to fulfill cultural practices. Owing to resource stewardship practice over millennia, Indigenous nations possess Indigenous knowledge that positions them as leaders in contemporary resource management. However, Indigenous peoples possibly face social-ecological traps, situations in which feedbacks between social and ecological systems result in an undesirable state, that are challenging to overcome. Centuries of compounding colonization and environmental degradation have negatively impacted Indigenous knowledge and culturally mediated stewardship practices. Our partnership, comprising academics and four First Nations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, mobilized information from semistructured interviews with knowledge holders to explore Indigenous knowledge of a culturally important but vulnerable species, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus). We analyzed interviews and discovered evidence of an extant but transcendable social-ecological trap. The emergent themes represent an exploration beyond our original project goals and research questions. Our study revealed that external forces of colonization, i.e., via forced assimilation, and species declines created a social-ecological trap. However, participants ubiquitously described stewardship principles, and noted ongoing cultural revitalization efforts, active recovery of depleted species, and reassertion of Indigenous management rights as ways they are rebelling against, and overcoming, the trap. Although the framing of a social-ecological trap may be perceived as diminishing the authority of Indigenous governance systems, we found the opposite to be true. Despite external pressures, coastal First Nations are reasserting cultural and management rights and shaping their futures. We suggest that ongoing Indigenous cultural renewal and ecosystem recovery in the face of the historically entrenched trap be supported through recognizing and implementing inherent Indigenous marine management rights. The social-ecological trap described here differs from others in the literature in that the creation of the trap was external; moving beyond it is happening through internal, i.e., led by the First Nations, efforts.},

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

abstract = {The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the largest feline in the Americas and third largest world-wide, smaller in size only to the tiger (P. tigris) and lion (P. leo). Yet, in comparison, relatively few studies on jaguar population densities have been conducted and baseline data for management purposes are needed. Camera trapping and capture-recapture sampling methods were used to estimate the size of a jaguar population in the Pantanal's open wet grassland habitat, an important area for the long-term survival of the species. This study is the first jaguar population estimate conducted in co-operation with a GPS-telemetry study providing an important opportunity for comparing different methods of density estimation. An accessible area within a 460 km2 privately-owned ranch was sampled with equal effort during the dry seasons of 2003 and 2004. Thirty-one and twenty-five individual jaguars were identified in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Estimates of jaguar abundance were generated by program CAPTURE. Density estimates were produced according to different methods used to calculate the effectively sampled areas which ranged from 274 to 568 km2. For 2003, the currently-used mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) method produced a density of 10.3 jaguars/100 km2, while GPS-telemetry-based calculations produced a mean density of 6.6 jaguars/100 km2. For 2004, the MMDM method produced an estimate of 11.7 jaguars/100 km2 while GPS-telemetry calculations produced a density of 6.7 jaguars/100 km2. Our results suggest that the widely-used MMDM method used to calculate effectively sampled areas is significantly under-reflecting maximum distances moved by jaguars and their range-use and, thereby, considerably inflating cat density estimates. This overestimation could place a population in a difficult situation by lengthening the time taken to initiate protection measures because of underestimating the risk to that population. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recruitment overfishing occurs when stocks are fished to a level where recruitment declines proportionally with adult abundance. Although typically considered a commercial fishery problem, recruitment overfishing can also occur in freshwater recreational fisheries. This study developed an age-structured model to determine if minimum-length limits can prevent recruitment overfishing in black crappie, Pomoxis nigromaculatus (LeSueur), and walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill) fisheries considering angling effort response to changes in fish abundance. Simulations showed that minimum-length limits prevented recruitment overfishing of black crappie and walleye, but larger minimum-length limits were required if angler effort showed only weak responses to changes in fish abundance. Low angler-effort responsiveness caused fishing mortality rates to remain high when stock abundance declined. By contrast, at high effort responsiveness, anglers left the fishery in response to stock declines and allowed stocks to recover. Angler effort for black crappie and walleye fisheries suggested that angler effort could be highly responsive for some fisheries and relatively stable for others, thereby increasing the risk of recruitment overfishing in real fisheries. Recruitment overfishing should be considered seriously in freshwater recreational fisheries, and more studies are needed to evaluate the responsiveness of angler effort to changes in fish abundance.},

Achieving this goal for data-poor stocks, for which stock assessments are not possible, is particularly challenging. A number of harvest control rules have very recently been developed to set sustainable catches in data-poor fisheries, but the ability of most of these rules to avoid overfishing has not been tested. We conducted a management strategy evaluation to assess several control rules proposed for data-poor situations. We examined three general life histories ("slow," "medium," and "fast") and three exploitation histories (under-, fully, and overexploited) to identify control rules that balance the competing objectives of avoiding overfishing and maintaining high levels of harvest. Many of the control rules require information on species life history and relative abundance, so we explored a scenario in which unbiased knowledge was used in the control rule and one in which highly inflated estimates of stock biomass were used. Our analyses showed that no single control rule performed well across all scenarios, with those that performed well in the unbiased scenario performing poorly in the biased scenarios and vice versa. Only the most conservative data-poor control rules limited the probability of overfishing across most of the life history and exploitation scenarios explored, but these rules typically required very conservative catches under the unbiased scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Analogously, ecological species sorting occurs when different environments are dominated by different competing species, each of which is relatively fit in its local conditions. The simplest theory predicts that spatial, but not temporal, environmental variation selects for local adaptation (or generates species sorting), but this prediction is difficult to test. Although organisms can be reciprocally transplanted among sites, doing so among times seems implausible. Here, we describe a reciprocal transplant experiment testing for local adaptation or species sorting of lake bacteria in response to both temporal and spatial variation in water chemistry. The experiment used a –80°C freezer as a “time machine.” Bacterial isolates and water samples were frozen for later use, allowing transplantation of older isolates “forward in time” and newer isolates “backward in time.” Surprisingly, local maladaptation predominated over local adaptation in both space and time. Such local maladaptation may indicate that adaptation, or the analogous species sorting process, fails to keep pace with temporal fluctuations in water chemistry. This hypothesis could be tested with more finely resolved temporal data.},

As far as possible, the individual functions have been introduced in the chapter to provide some explanation of the response to environmental factors, without deviating from the major purpose of examining the recorded trends in the activity of growing. In relation to environmental effects, quite obviously growth cannot be studied without involving food consumption, even though the latter may not necessarily be measured. In this respect, growing—unlike such activities as swimming or respiring—is inseparably coupled with a powerful biotic factor, so that any abiotic factor is necessarily involved in some form of interaction between the two. Growth rate may either increase or decrease depending on the nature of the food × metabolism × temperature relation; on analysis it can be seen that the energy demand of elevated metabolic rate could have exceeded the gain from increased food uptake resulting in reduced growth rate. Furthermore, the act of growing necessarily alters size so that another important biotic factor continually changes with time. An understanding of these inherent involvements is necessary before any clear insight of the environmental relation to the growth process can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 1979, Academic Press Inc.},

abstract = {1. The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations. 2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature. 3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities. 4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Migrating salmonids often return to their spawning habitats in overlapping timing patterns of multiple stocks (populations) collectively called a run that varies in its genetic makeup across and within years. Managers, tasked with developing harvest strategies on these runs, may have preseason estimates of total run size but little information on run timing. Without both it is difficult to assess a run's status in real time. Consequently, to avoid overharvest, managers tend to control the timing of harvest. However, this strategy may inadvertently affect the component stocks disproportionately and therefore the run's diversity. Thus, accurate estimates of run timing are needed to improve management. We developed a model that includes genetic and environmental factors to predict the mean run timing of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, Oregon, USA. The model predicted mean run timing (P < 0.00001, r2 = 0.78) by characterizing genetic run timing components from the arrival timing of precocious males returning one year prior to the remainder of the adults and environmental influences of oceanic and riverine flows that impede or advance the run timing. Variations in the relative abundances of the populations in the run explain 62% of the interannual variation in mean run timing while the oceanic and riverine factors combined account for 15.5%. We suggest that when genetic run timing characteristics are preserved in species with multiple maturation strategies the information can be used to improve run time predictions and maintain genetic diversity of harvested species {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological society of America.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence has indicated that many fish populations are responding to climate change through shifts in migration time, but genetic data identifying the role of evolution in these shifts are rare. One of the first demonstrations of evolution of migration time was produced by monitoring allozyme alleles that were experimentally manipulated to genetically mark late-migrating pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). Here, we extend that research by using observations of the marker alleles in fry to demonstrate that these changes in migration time were caused by directional selection against the late-migrating phenotype during the oceanic phase of the salmonid life cycle. The selective event, which appeared to be driven by early vernal warming of the nearshore marine environment and consequent decreased survival of late-migrating fry relative to earlymigrating fry, decreased the late-migrating phenotype from more than 50% to approximately 10% of the total fry abundance in only one generation. These demographic changes have persisted over the subsequent 13 generations and suggest that a larger trend toward earlier migration time in this population may reflect adaptation to warming sea-surface temperatures.},

abstract = {Subspecies of inland cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii occupy a fraction of their historic \nranges, and displacement by nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis is among the greatest threats to \nexisting populations in small, headwater streams. Electrofishing is often used to suppress brook trout and \nenhance cutthroat trout populations, but these efforts are labor intensive and costly. To help managers more \neffectively plan and implement brook trout control programs, we used survival estimates from a field \nexperiment to construct matrix population models for both species and linked the models by making the vital \nrates of young cutthroat trout a function of brook trout density to represent the effect of invasion. We then \nexplored the response of cutthroat trout populations (growth rate [k] and probability of persistence for 50 \nyears) to brook trout suppression across various levels of electrofishing frequency, sampling intensity, capture \nefficiency, and brook trout immigration rate. Cutthroat trout (k¼1.10) and brook trout (k¼1.20) both had \nmoderate to high values of k when biotic interactions were weak or absent, but the cutthroat trout k declined \nmarkedly (k ¼ 0.61) when biotic interactions with brook trout were strong. Model results supported the \nhypothesis that rapid displacement of cutthroat trout is facilitated by the brook trout's inherent demographic \nadvantage and biotic effects on young cutthroat trout. Where annual brook trout suppression was not possible, \nthe temporal distribution of suppression events within a systematic control design strongly influenced the \nresponse of cutthroat trout. The absolute response and cost effectiveness of suppression efforts were \ninfluenced particularly by the brook trout immigration rate and also by removal efficiency. Multiple \nconsecutive years of suppression (!3 years) benefited cutthroat trout, but to be effective such suppression \nshould not be interrupted for more than two consecutive years once initiated. Eradication would be ideal, but \nthe maintenance control of brook trout and the management of cutthroat trout in sympatry with brook trout \nwill probably remain among the viable management options for the foreseeable future.},

abstract = {The resilience of organisms to large-scale environmental and climatic change depends, in part, upon the ability to colonize and occupy new habitats. While previous efforts to describe homing, or natal site fidelity, of migratory organisms have been hindered by the confounding effects of fragmented landscapes and management practices, realistic conservation efforts must include considerations of the behavioral diversity represented by animal movements and dispersal. Herein, we quantify straying away from natal origins by adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in a wild population that inhabits a pristine wilderness basin. Using natural isotopic signatures (87Sr/ 86Sr) to reconstruct the migratory behaviors of unhandled individuals over their entire life cycle, we identified ecological and behavioral factors influencing the propensity to stray. Our results indicate that natal site fidelity is scale dependent, ranging from 55% at ∼1-km distances to 87% at longer (>10-km scale) distances, and juvenile dispersal and sex highly influence straying occurrence. These findings lend support for the conservation of behavioral diversity for population persistence, and we propose straying as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity at low population densities. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Explanations for the ubiquitous presence of spatially synchronous population dynamics have assumed that density-dependent processes governing the dynamics of local populations are identical among disjunct populations, and low levels of dispersal or small amounts of regionalized stochasticity ("Moran effect") can act to synchronize populations. In this study we used historical spatially referenced data on gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreaks to document that density-dependent processes can vary substantially across geographical landscapes. This variation may be due in part to geographical variation in habitat (e.g., variation in forest composition). We then used a second-order log-linear stochastic model to explore how inter-population variation in density-dependent processes affects synchronization via either synchronous stochastic forcing or dispersal. We found that geographical variation in direct density-dependence (first order) greatly diminishes synchrony caused by stochasticity but only slightly decreases synchronization via dispersal. Variation in delayed density-dependence (second order) diluted synchrony caused by regional stochasticity to a lesser extent than first-order variation, but it did not have any influence on synchrony caused by dispersal. In general, synchronization caused by dispersal was primarily dependent upon the instability of populations and only weakly, if at all, affected by similarities in density-dependence among populations. We conclude that studies of synchrony should carefully consider both the nature of the synchronizing agents and the pattern of local density-dependent processes, including how these vary geographically.},

Mean (±SE) parr-to-smolt survival of the early migrating cohorts was 45.4 ± 6.3% (n = 13) compared with 37.4 ± 4.7% (n = 13) for later migrating cohorts. Annual mean parr-to-smolt survival differed widely across years ranging from a low of 9.6 ± 0.5% (n = 2) in 2001 to a high of 81.7 ± 4.6% (n = 2) in 1999. Parr growth prior to reservoir entry and reservoir velocity provided the most information on variability in parr-to-smolt survival (N = 26, R2 = 0.75, corrected Akaike's information criterion [AICc]=-5.01). We suggest that parr growth and reservoir velocity were directly proportional to parr-to-smolt survival because fast growth and downstream movement reduces the time when fish are vulnerable to predators. The effect of reservoir velocity comports with previous published studies and supports management efforts to increase reservoir velocity. Few if any published studies explicitly relate parr growth measured on individual fish to survival estimated for their cohorts in freshwater. This study provides empirical evidence that upholds the long-held belief that any anthropogenic activity that reduces growth of juvenile salmonids during freshwater rearing has the potential to reduce their survival.},

The first study evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of weathered, unweathered and dispersed Access Western Blend (AWB) dilbit on Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). In the second study, acute and chronic toxicity of weathered and unweathered Cold Lake Blend (CLB) dilbit was assessed on Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and two invertebrate species, Daphnia (Daphnia magna) and Ceriodaphnia (Ceriodaphnia dubia). For Fathead minnow, unweathered AWB WAF demonstrated a significantly higher acute toxicity (LC50–96 h = 0.628 g/L) compared to the weathered AWB WAF (LC50–96 h = 2.06 g/L). Chronic toxicity tests showed that Fathead minnow lethality was also higher for unweathered AWB (LC50-7 d = 0.593 g/L) compared to the weathered AWB (LC50-7 d = 1.31 g/L) whereas larval growth toxicity was lower for unweathered AWB (IC25-7 d=0.312 g/L) compared to the weathered dilbit (IC25-7 d = 0.096 g/L). Rainbow trout exposed to unweathered CLB demonstrated a significantly higher toxicity (LC50–96 h = 5.66 g/L) compared to the weathered CLB (LC50 > 18 g/L). Lethality (LC50 = 6.43 g/L) was observed in Ceriodaphnia exposed to the CLB WAF while no mortality was observed with the weathered CLB. The reproductive effects on Ceriodaphnia were greater with the CLB (IC25 <1.0) than with the weathered CLB (IC25 = 3.99 g/L). Volatile organic compounds (VOC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) increased as the dilbit CLB and AWB WAF concentrations increased. The total VOC and the total PAHs (including the alkylated PAHs) presented similar concentrations in the weathered and unweathered AWB WAF. These compounds seem therefore not be affected by the AWB WAF weathering process. However, VOC and PAH concentrations decreased significantly in the Rainbow trout and Ceriodaphnia toxicity tests using the weathered CLB WAF. VOC and PAH concentrations were also lower in the weathered AWB CEWAF used for Fathead minnow chronic study.},

Operationalising broader ecological and social objectives has been particularly problematic. In fisheries management, the focus has mainly been on target species sustainability and, in the past few decades, on profitability. However, multi-objective management is now essential as fisheries have become recognised as complex social-ecological-systems. Policy and legislation demand a move towards quantitative approaches for reconciling multiple objectives and operationalising these within harvest strategies. We present a quantitative, non-commensurable-unit approach , via a multi-indicator value function with explicit objective preference weights. We use a simulation to set Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for three main species groups in a reef line fishery in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Our method enables stakeholders to consider a richer range of tradeoffs than is possible with bio-economic models. Moreover, it allows the formal evaluation of performance across alternative stakeholder group preferences , providing an impartial way to obtain an overall optimum TAC. The simulation requires extensive fishery data and requires the performance indicators associated with each objective to be quantitatively and defensibly defined. Thus, our approach provides a pathway forward that forces managers and stakeholders to confront the associated data requirements.},

Surveys of terrestrial species have suggested that large-bodied species and top predators are the most at risk, and it is commonly assumed that such patterns also apply in the ocean. However, there has been no global test of this hypothesis in the sea. We analyzed two fisheries datasets (stock assessments and landings) to determine the life-history traits of species that have suffered dramatic population collapses. Contrary to expectations, our data suggest that up to twice as many fisheries for small, low trophic-level species have collapsed compared with those for large predators. These patterns contrast with those on land, suggesting fundamental differences in the ways that industrial fisheries and land conversion affect natural communities. Even temporary collapses of small, low trophic-level fishes can have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

We investigated the contribution of plasticity and local adaptation to the performance of a common aquatic plant (Potamogeton pectinatus) in contrasting climates, using reciprocal transplants at three experimental sites across a latitudinal cline in Europe. Plants from 54 genets, originally collected from 14 populations situated within four climatic regions (subarctic, cold temperate, mild temperate, and mediterranean) were grown in three different localities within three of these regions (cold temperate, Norway; mild temperate, The Netherlands; mediterranean, Spain). Tuber production was highest for the mild-temperate genets, irrespective of locality where the genets were grown. Selection coefficients indicated that populations at the European center of the species distribution perform better than all other populations, at all sites. However, marginal populations showed changes in life-history traits, such as compressed life cycles in the north and true perenniality in the south, that may allow them to perform better locally, at the limits of their distribution range. Our results thus suggest that local adaptation may overlap spatially with center&#8211;periphery gradients in performance caused by genetic factors (such as genetic drift and inbreeding in range-marginal populations).},

We formulate the model using dynamic state variables and take advantage of related techniques for parameter estimation, such as an extended Kalman filter. Our recruitment function depends explicitly on parameters relevant to management and includes various cases of historical interest. We adopt Bayesian methods for assessing uncertainty and use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to obtain posterior samples. A worked example, based on simulated data, illustrates geometric relationships among model choices, estimated recruitment curves, and data interpretations.},

abstract = {A simple argument based on the distribution of individuals amongst discrete resource sites is used to show how the form of single species population models depends on the type of competition between, and the spatial clustering of, the individuals. For scramble competition between individuals, we confirm earlier demonstrations that the Ricker model is a direct consequence of a uniform random distribution of individuals across resources. By introducing spatial clustering of individuals according to a negative binomial distribution, we are able to derive the Hassell model. Furthermore, the tent map model is seen to be a consequence of scramble competition and an ideal-free distribution of individuals. To model contest competition under different degrees of spatial clustering we derive a new three-parameter model, of which the Beverton-Holt and Skellam models are special cases, where one of the parameters relates directly to the clustering distribution. Other population models, such as the quadratic model and the theta-Ricker models, cannot be derived in our framework. Taken together our derivations of population models allows us to make a more rigorous prescription for model choice when fitting to particular datasets. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Life history theory predicts a range of directional generic responses in life history traits with increasing organism size. Among these are the relationships between size and longevity, mortality, growth rate, timing of maturity, and lifetime reproductive output. Spanning three orders of magnitude in size, coral reef fishes provide an ecologically diverse and species-rich vertebrate assemblage in which to test these generic responses. Here we examined these relationships by quantifying the life cycles of three miniature species of coral reef fish from the genus Eviota (Gobiidae) and compared their life history characteristics with other reef fish species. We found that all three species of Eviota have life spans of < 100 days, suffer high daily mortality rates of 7-8%, exhibit rapid linear growth, and matured at an earlier than expected size. Although lifetime reproductive output was low, consistent with their small body sizes, short generation times of 47-74 days help overcome low individual fecundity and appear to be a critical feature in maintaining Eviota populations. Comparisons with other coral reef fish species showed that Eviota species live on the evolutionary margins of life history possibilities for vertebrate animals. This addition of demographic information on these smallest size classes of coral reef fishes greatly extends our knowledge to encompass the full size spectrum and highlights the potential for coral reef fishes to contribute to vertebrate life history studies.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances and habitat degradation are major factors influencing the dynamics and persistence of many wildlife populations, yet few large-scale studies have explored the relative influence of these factors on the dynamics and persistence of animal populations. We used longterm demographic data and matrix population models to examine the potential effects of habitat degradation and natural disturbances on the dynamics of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. We found that estimates of stochastic population growth rate were low (0.90). Population growth rate ($\lambda$) during the first half or our study period (1992 to 1998) was substantially greater than during the second half (1999 to 2005). These 2 periods were characterized by contrasting hydrological conditions. Although $\lambda$ was most sensitive to changes in adult survival, the analysis of life table response experiments revealed that a reduction in fertility of kites accounted for >80% of the observed decline in population growth rate. We examined the possibility that the reduction in $\lambda$ was caused by (1) habitat degradation due to management, (2) an increase in frequency of moderate drying events in recent years, and (3) both habitat degradation and an increase in frequency of moderate drying events. Our results suggest that both factors could potentially contribute to a large decrease in population growth rate. Our study highlights the importance of simultaneously considering short- and long-term effects of disturbances when modeling population dynamics. Indeed, focusing exclusively on one type of effect may be misleading to both our understanding of the ecological dynamics of the system and to management. The relevance of our results to management is heightened because the snail kite has been selected as a key performance measure of one of the most ambitious ecosystem restoration projects ever undertaken. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {Understanding the predictive ability of recreation specialization to explain behavior is important for wildlife and fisheries management given the widespread use of specialization to capture diversity among outdoor recreationists. Using allocation of days among fishing opportunities in a discrete choice experiment, we studied the extent that specialization predicted preferences for attributes describing the opportunities. Latent class modeling revealed that three groups of anglers optimally captured preference diversity in our sample. To this base model, we sequentially added 11 metrics of angler specialization and used information theory to select the metric that best predicted group membership, namely centrality to lifestyle. Weaker evidence existed for the specialization dimensions “importance of catch,” “specialized gear use,” and a multidimensional self-classification approach, whereas indices of skill, media use, trophy fish, and harvest orientation were not supported. General specialization constructs such as centrality to lifestyle, therefore, might be best suited for predicting general fishing preferences and subsequent behaviors of anglers.

Changes in high-seas habitat due to natural climatic variation in 20th century were small relative to that under anthropogenic climate change scenarios for the middle to late 21st century. Under a multimodel ensemble average of global climate model outputs using A1B (medium) emissions scenario for the entire study area (North Pacific and part of Arctic Ocean), projected winter habitats of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) decreased by 38%, and summer habitat decreased by 86% for Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), 45% for sockeye, 36% for steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), 30% for coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), 30% for pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), and 29% for chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon by 2100. Reductions were 25% lower for B1 (lower) emissions and 7% higher for A2 (higher) emissions scenarios. Projected habitat losses were largest in the Gulf of Alaska and western and central subarctic North Pacific. Nearly complete losses of Gulf of Alaska habitat for sockeye in both seasons and Chinook in summer raise important policy issues for North American fishery managers and governments.},

abstract = {In the presence of choice-based sampling strategies for data collection, the property of multinomial logit (MNL) models, that consistent estimates of all parameters but the constants can be obtained from an exogenous sample maximum likelihood (ESML) estimation, does not hold in general for generalized extreme value (GEV) models. We propose a consistent ESML estimator for GEV models in this context. We first identify a specific class of GEV models with the desired property that, similarly to MNL, the constants absorb the potential bias. We then propose a new and simple weighted conditional maximum likelihood (WCML) estimator for the more general case. Contrarily to the weighted exogenous sample maximum likelihood (WESML) estimator by Manski and Lerman [Manski, C., Lerman, S., 1977. The estimation of choice probabilities from choice-based samples. Econometrica 45, 1977-1988], the new WCML estimator does not require an external knowledge of the market shares. We show that this applies also to the case where alternatives are sampled from a large choice set, and we illustrate the use of the estimator on synthetic and real data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The prevalence of these PEs in aquatic organisms is as yet unknown, and can be difficult to quantify; however, understanding mecha- nisms that stabilize populations in the face of environmen- tal change is a key concern in ecology. Here, we examine PEs in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Puget Sound (USA) using a 40-year time series of biomass data for 19 distinct spawning population units collected using two sur- vey types. Multivariate auto-regressive state-space models show independent dynamics among spawning subpopu- lations, suggesting that variation in herring production is partially driven by local effects at spawning grounds or during the earliest life history stages. This independence at the subpopulation level confers a stabilizing effect on the overall Puget Sound spawning stock, with herring being as much as three times more stable in the face of environmen- tal perturbation than a single population unit of the same size. Herring populations within Puget Sound are highly asynchronous but share a common negative growth rate and may be influenced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The biocomplexity in the herring stock shown here dem- onstrates that preserving spatial and demographic diversity can increase the stability of this herring population and its availability as a resource for consumers.},

Such “metapopulations” can have extremely complex dynamics. We present a new general model that uses only two functions to capture, at the metapopulation scale, the main behavior of metapopulations. We show how complex, structured metapopulation models can be translated into our generalized framework. The metapopulation dynamics arising from some important biological processes are illustrated: the rescue effect, the Allee effect, and what we term the “antirescue effect.” The antirescue effect captures instances where high migration rates are deleterious to population persistence, a phenomenon that has been largely ignored in metapopulation conservation theory.

abstract = {<p> Studies of climate effects on ecology often account for non-stationarity in individual physical and biological variables, but rarely allow for non-stationary relationships among variables. Here, we show that non-stationary relationships among physical and biological variables are central to understanding climate effects on salmon ( <italic>Onchorynchus</italic> spp.) in the Gulf of Alaska during 1965–2012. The relative importance of two leading patterns in North Pacific climate, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), changed around 1988/1989 as reflected by changing correlations with leading axes of sea surface temperature variability. Simultaneously, relationships between the PDO and Gulf of Alaska environmental variables weakened, and long-standing temperature–salmon and PDO–salmon covariance declined to zero. We propose a mechanistic explanation for changing climate–salmon relationships in terms of non-stationary atmosphere–ocean interactions coinciding with changing PDO–NPGO relative importance. We also show that regression models assuming stationary climate–salmon relationships are inappropriate over the multidecadal time scale we consider. Relaxing assumptions of stationary relationships markedly improved modelling of climate effects on salmon catches and productivity. Attempts to understand the implications of changing climate patterns in other ecosystems might also be aided by the application of models that allow associations among environmental and biological variables to change over time. </p>},

In this study the fourth relation, that between asymptotic size and the growth coefficient, L-inf = CK-h, was obtained from a bioenergetic growth equation. A numerical value of h = 0.33 was predicted, and this agrees with the observed value. The relation between the growth coefficient K and size L-inf results from the limited amount of assimilated food that must be used both for growth and body functions, and the body functions are a function of body size.

abstract = {Many exploited reef fish are vulnerable to overfishing because they concentrate over hard-bottom patchy habitats. How mobile reef fish use patchy habitat, and the potential consequences on demographic parameters, must be known for spatially explicit population dynamics modeling, for discriminating essential fish habitat (EFH), and for effectively planning conservation measures (e.g., marine protected areas, stock enhancement, and artificial reefs). Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis, is an ecologically and economically important warm-temperate grouper in the southeastern United States, with behavioral and life history traits conducive to large-scale field experiments. The Suwannee Regional Reef System (SRRS) was built of standard habitat units (SHUs) in 1991-1993 to manipulate and control habitat patchiness and intrinsic habitat quality, and thereby test predictions from habitat selection theory. Colonization of the SRRS by gag over the first six years showed significant interactions of SHU size, spacing, and reef age; with trajectories modeled using a quadratic function for closely spaced SHUs (25 m) and a linear model for widely spaced SHUs (225 m), with larger SHUs (16 standardized cubes) accumulating significantly more gag faster than smaller 4-cube SHUs (mean = 72.5 gag/16-cube SHU at 225-m spacing by year 6, compared to 24.2 gag/4-cube SHU for same spacing and reef age). Residency times (mean = 9.8 mo), indicative of choice and measured by ultrasonic telemetry (1995-1998), showed significant interaction of SHU size and spacing consistent with colonization trajectories. Average relative weight (W(r)) and incremental growth were greater on smaller than larger SHUs (mean W(r) = 104.2 vs. 97.7; incremental growth differed by 15%), contrary to patterns of abundance and residency. Experimental manipulation of shelter on a subset of SRRS sites (2000-2001) confirmed our hypothesis that shelter limits local densities of gag, which, in turn, regulates their growth and condition. Density-dependent habitat selection for shelter and individual growth dynamics were therefore interdependent ecological processes that help to explain how patchy reef habitat sustains gag production. Moreover, gag selected shelter at the expense of maximizing their growth. Thus, mobile reef fishes could experience density-dependent effects on growth, survival, and/or reproduction (i.e., demographic parameters) despite reduced stock sizes as a consequence of fishing.},

abstract = {For Pacific salmon, the key fisheries management goal in British Columbia (BC) is to maintain and restore healthy and diverse Pacific salmon populations, making conservation of salmon biodiversity the highest priority for resource management decision-making. Salmon status assessments are often conducted on coded-wire-tagged subsets of indicator populations based on assumptions of little differentiation within or among proximal populations. In the current study of southern BC coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) populations, parentage-based tagging (PBT) analysis provided novel information on migration and life-history patterns to test the assumptions of biological homogeneity over limited (generally < 100 km) geographic distances and, potentially, to inform management of fisheries and hatchery broodstocks. Heterogeneity for location and timing of fishery captures, family productivity, and exploitation rate was observed over small geographic scales, within regions that are, or might be expected to be, within the area encompassed by a single-tagged indicator population. These results provide little support for the suggestion that information gained from tagged indicator populations is representative of marine distribution, productivity, and exploitation patterns of proximal populations.},

First, a standardized open-field behavioural assay was developed to assess individual behaviour of wild-captured adult E. lucius. Behaviour within the standardized assay predicted swimming behaviour in the lake, providing an ecological validation of the assay. There was no relationship between standardized behaviour and any of the life-history and state variables, including metabolism, body condition, juvenile growth rate and adult growth rate in contrast to predictions from the pace-of-life hypothesis. This study demonstrates that it is possible to assess ecologically relevant behavioural variation in a large-bodied top predator using a standard open-field assay, but it is noteworthy that this standardized behaviour is not systematically related to standard metabolism or growth.},

abstract = {Background: Ongoing global ocean warming and a recent increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves have demonstrably impacted marine ecosystems. Growing evidence points to both short-and longterm biological changes, across several levels of organization. While range shifts are among the predicted responses, few studies are focused solely on documenting such changes. Here we report ecological changes in response to marine heatwaves across multiple taxa in the eastern Pacific from central California to Baja California. Methods: Sea surface temperature data from two estuaries and one coastal site were analyzed to define the number, duration, and intensity of marine heatwaves occurring in central and southern California from 2013 to 2018. Long-term monitoring programs and short-term research projects in coastal and estuarine ecosystems serendipitously collected specimens or photographs of extralimital species from central California to the Baja California Peninsula. Spatial and temporal sampling protocols and the targeted species for six unrelated programs varied greatly, from annual to monthly at both fixed and variable locations. In addition, anomalous occurrences were reported to staff at local and regional marine and estuarine protected areas and noted in local news and social media outlets. Anomalous range detections were categorized as range expansions and extensions, reappearances, abundance increases, shifts into new habitats, and range contractions. Results: Multiple marine heatwaves occurred from 2014 to 2018, peaking in 2015. Marine heatwaves were more intense and longer in the estuaries, with a maximum duration of 109 days in 2015. We observed 29 species that had responded to the warm water anomalies of 2014-2018 along the eastern Pacific Ocean between central California and the Baja California Peninsula: 7 expansions, 2 extensions, 10 reappearances, 7 increases, 2 shifts into new habitats, and 1 apparent contraction. These shifts included algae, invertebrates and fishes. Twenty species were observed by professional biologists involved both in long-term monitoring programs and short-term studies, 6 by amateur naturalists as part of community-based science programs in the field, and 3 through a combination of all three Conclusions: Increased warm waters, sustained for an unprecedented 4 of 5 years, facilitated the northward redistribution of multiple species from several taxonomic groups. Species shifting northward were from warmtemperate and subtropical ecosystems to the south. In the absence of programs designed to detect range shifts, we must rely on the serendipitous observations of biologists conducting both long-term monitoring and short-term research, and the growing wealth of information from community-based science programs made available via online databases.},

abstract = {1. Understanding spatial structure and identifying subpopulations are critical for estimating popu- lation growth rates and extinction risk, and as such essential for effective conservation planning. However, movement and spatiotemporal environmental data are often unavailable, limiting our ability to directly define subpopulations and their level of asynchrony. 2. This study applies a recently developed statistical technique using time-series analysis of abun- dance data to identify subpopulations. The approach uses multivariate state-space models and Akaike's Information Criterion-based model selection to quantify the data support for different subpopulation numbers and configurations. This technique is applied to the population of Califor- nia sea lions Zalophus californianus in theGulf ofCalifornia,Mexico, distributed across 13 breeding sites. 3. The abundance ofCalifornia sea lions in theGulf of California has declined over the last decade, though not all areas have been equally affected. In light of this variation, it is important to under- stand the population structure to ensure accurate viability assessments and effectivemanagement. 4. Our data support the hypothesis that theGulf ofCalifornia sea lion population has four subpop- ulations, eachwith 2–5 breeding sites. The dynamics between several adjacent subpopulationswere correlated, suggesting that they experience similar environmental variation. For each subpopula- tion, we estimated long-term growth rates, aswell as the environmental and observation variation. 5. For most of the subpopulations, our estimates of growth rates were considerably lower than those previously reported. In addition, we found considerable variability across subpopulations in their projected risk of severe decline over the next 50 years. 6. Synthesis and applications. Weillustrate a newmultivariate state-spacemodelling technique that uses timeseriesofabundancetoquantifythedatasupportfordifferentsubpopulationconfigurations. Our analysis of theCalifornia sea lion population in theGulf ofCalifornia indicates that the popula- tionisspatiallystructuredintofoursubpopulations,eachexhibitingdistinct risks ofextinction.Based on our results, we recommend that conservation and management efforts in the Gulf of California focus on the two subpopulations with high probabilities of extinction within the next 50 years (NorthernMidriff, SouthernMidriff).Multivariate state-spacemodels provide a practical approach to determine the spatial structure of virtually any species; theymay be particularly useful for species ofconservationconcernforwhichdataondispersalandenvironmentaldrivers are likelytobe scarce.},

abstract = {This study presents a historical review, a meta-analysis, and recommendations for users about weight–length relationships, condition factors and relative weight equations. The historical review traces the developments of the respective concepts. The meta-analysis explores 3929 weight–length relationships of the typeW ¼ aLb for 1773 species of fishes. It shows that 82% of the variance in a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species. Across species median b ¼ 3.03 is significantly larger than 3.0, thus indicating a tendency towards slightly positive-allometric growth (increase in relative body thickness or plumpness) in most fishes. The expected range of 2.5 < b < 3.5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two weight–length relationships per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in weight–length relationships. An equation to calcu- late mean condition factors from weight–length relationships is given as Kmean ¼ 100aLb)3. Relative weight Wrm ¼ 100W/ (amLbm ) can be used for comparing the condition of individuals across populations, where am is the geometric mean of a and bm is the mean of b across all available weight–length relationships for a given species. Twelve recommendations for proper use and presentation of weight–length relationships, condition factors and relative weight are given. Introduction},

Methods to quantify this heterogeneity among populations in mixed-stock fisheries are not well-established but are critical to assessing harvest–biodiversity trade-offs when setting harvest policies. We developed an integrated, age-structured, state-space model that allows for more complete use of available data and sharing of information than simpler methods. We compared a suite of state-space models of varying structural complexity to simpler regression-based approaches and, as an example case, fitted them to data from 13 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations in the Kuskokwim drainage in western Alaska. We found biological and policy conclusions were largely consistent among state-space models but differed strongly from regression-based approaches. Simulation trials illustrated our state-space models were largely unbiased with respect to spawner–recruit parameters, abundance states, and derived biological reference points, whereas the regression-based approaches showed substantial bias. These findings suggest our state-space model shows promise for informing harvest policy evaluations of harvest–biodiversity trade-offs in mixed-stock salmon fisheries.},

Aquatic surface respiration (ASR) thresholds were lowest for H. letourneuxi, followed by L. gulosus, then L. marginatus. The ASR thresholds for L. marginatus were within ranges reported for small, freshwater tropical fishes, while those for L. gulosus were similar to swamp-adapted fishes. For H. letourneuxi, ASR thresholds were some of the lowest reported. All three species showed excellent tolerance of low dissolved oxygen levels when allowed access to the surface. When denied surface access, L. marginatus lost equilibrium at a higher oxygen tension than the other species. Overall, although all species easily tolerated hypoxia, H. letourneuxi appeared to be best equipped to deal with hypoxia, followed by L. gulosus, then L. marginatus. Hemichromis letourneuxi also exhibited more aggressive behaviours than the centrarchids. These results suggest that hypoxia is not likely to prevent H. letourneuxi from exploiting the seasonally inundated wetlands of south Florida while expanding its range there.

@article{Pauly2009,
abstract = {The three decades following World War II were a period of rapidly increasing fishing effort and landings, but also of spectacular collapses, particularly in small pelagic fish stocks. This is also the period in which a toxic triad of catch underreporting, ignoring scientific advice and blaming the environment emerged as standard response to ongoing fisheries collapses, which became increasingly more frequent, finally engulfing major North Atlantic fisheries. The response to the depletion of traditional fishing grounds was an expansion of North Atlantic (and generally of northern hemisphere) fisheries in three dimensions: southward, into deeper waters and into new taxa, i.e. catching and marketing species of fish and invertebrates previously spurned, and usually lower in the food web. This expansion provided many opportunities for mischief, as illustrated by the European Union's negotiated ‘agreements' for access to the fish resources of Northwest Africa, China's agreement-fee exploitation of the same, and Japan blaming the resulting resource declines on the whales. Also, this expansion provided new opportunities for mislabelling seafood unfamiliar to North Americans and Europeans, and misleading consumers, thus reducing the impact of seafood guides and similar effort toward sustainability. With fisheries catches declining, aquaculture—despite all public relation efforts—not being able to pick up the slack, and rapidly increasing fuel prices, structural changes are to be expected in both the fishing industry and the scientific disciplines that study it and influence its governance. Notably, fisheries biology, now predominantly concerned with the welfare of the fishing industry, will have to be converted into fisheries conservation science, whose goal will be to resolve the toxic triad alluded to above, and thus maintain the marine biodiversity and ecosystems that provide existential services to fisheries. Similarly, fisheries economists will have to get past their obsession with privatising fisheries resources, as their stated goal of providing the proper incentives to fishers can be achieved without giving away what are, after all, public resources. Overall, the crisis that fisheries are now going through can be seen as an opportunity to renew both their structure—away from fuel-intensive largescale fisheries—and their governance, and to renew the disciplines which study fisheries, creating a fisheries conservation science in the process. Its greatest achievement will be the creation of a global network of Marine Protected Areas, which, as anticipated by Ramon Margalef, is the way to make controlled exploitation compatible with the continued existence of functioning marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {The total world catch from marine and freshwater wild stocks has peaked and may be slightly declining. There appear to be few significant resources to be developed, and the majority of the world's fish stocks are intensively exploited. Many marine ecosystems have been profoundly changed by fishing and other human activities. Although most of the world's major fisheries continue to produce substantial sustainable yield, a number have been severely overfished, and many more stocks appear to be heading toward depletion. The world's fisheries continue to be heavily subsidized, which encourages overfishing and provides society with a small fraction of the potential economic benefits. In most of the world's fisheries there is a "race for fish" in which boats compete to catch the fish before a quota is achieved or the fish are caught by someone else. The race for fish leads to economic inefficiency, poor quality product, and pressure to extract every fish for short-term gain. A number of countries have instituted alternative management practices that eliminate the race for fish and encourage economic efficiency, use lower exploitation rates that deliberately do not attempt to maximize biological yield, and encourage reduced fishing costs and increased value of products. In fisheries where this transition has taken place, we see the potential for future sustainability, but in those fisheries where the race for fish continues, we anticipate further declines in abundance, further loss of jobs and fishing communities, and potential structural change to marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Management areas are used in marine spatial planning to conserve biodiversity of marine ecosystems and to protect fish from fishing pressure. To evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas, observational techniques are used to determine densities, sizes, biomass, habitat types and distribution of fish species in and around management areas. Two types of observational techniques are used in spatial monitoring: (1) fishery-independent techniques, which include underwater visual census (UVC), underwater video, remote sensing, acoustics, and experimental catch and effort data; and (2) fishery-dependent techniques, which include catch, effort and catch per unit effort data from commercial and recreational fisheries. This review summarises the applications, advantages, disadvantages and biases of each of these observational categories and highlights emerging technologies. The main finding from this review was that a combination of observational techniques, rather than a single method, was the most effective approach to marine spatial monitoring. For example, a combination of hydroacoustics for habitat mapping and UVC or video for fish surveys was one of the most cost-effective and efficient means of obtaining fish-habitat linkages and fish assemblage data. There are also emerging technologies that could increase the precision and efficiency of monitoring surveys. There is a need for continued development of non-intrusive technology for marine monitoring studies.},

Two major types of models are commonly used to assess vulnerability and to rank management options: population-based stochastic simulation models (PSM such as RAMAS or VORTEX) and stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOM). While the first set of models relies on explicit intrapatch dynamics and interpatch dispersal to predict population levels in space and time, the latter is based on spatially explicit metapopulation theory where the probability of patch occupation is predicted given the patch area and isolation (patch topology). We applied both approaches to a European tree frog (Hyla arborea) metapopulation in western Switzerland in order to evaluate the concordances of both models and their applications to conservation. Although some quantitative discrepancies appeared in terms of network occupancy and equilibrium population size, the two approaches were largely concordant regarding the ranking of patch values and sensitivities to parameters, which is encouraging given the differences in the underlying paradigms and input data.},

abstract = {Ocean systems, and the culturally and commercially important fishes that inhabit them, face growing threats. Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to inform fisheries research and management for data-poor species. Listed as a species of special concern in Canada, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of this species over the last $\sim$60 years, and the factors driving these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size and abundance were compared with current biological survey data. Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out and 89% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance since their earliest fishing experiences (1950s to1980s, depending on participant's age), with a third suggesting the change was most evident in the early 2000s, followed by the 1980s (21%) and 1990s (17%). Sizes of modern yelloweye rockfish estimated by participants resembled estimates derived from ecological data recorded concurrently at the study region. This study illustrates a repeatable method for using traditional and local knowledge to extend baselines for data-poor species, and highlights the value of integrating Indigenous knowledge into fisheries research and management.},

abstract = {The identity of an individual patch as a source or a sink within a metapopulation is a function of its ability to produce individuals and to disperse them to other patches. In marine systems patch identity is very often defined by dispersal ability alone-upstream patches are sources-while issues of variable habitat quality (which affects local production) are ignored. This can have important ramifications for the science of marine reserve siting. This study develops a spatially explicit source-sink metapopulation model for reef fish and uses it to evaluate the relative importance of connectivity versus demography and how this depends upon the level of local larval retention and the strength of density-dependent recruitment. Elasticity analyses indicated that patch contribution (source or sink) was more sensitive to demographic parameters (particularly survival) than connectivity and this effect was conserved even under strong levels of density-dependence and was generally strengthened as local retention increased. Variability in the relationship between parameter elasticity and local retention was shown to be dependent upon the magnitude of connectivity for an individual patch relative to a critical connectivity value. The proportion of larvae lost due to transport processes was an important parameter which directly affected the magnitude of this critical connectivity value. Patches with connectivity values less than the critical value contributed to the metapopulation largely via production (i.e., local demographics most important). As local retention increased, so did the importance of demographic parameters in these patches. Patches with connectivity values greater than the critical value contributed largely via dispersal of larvae and thus the importance of local demographics decreased as local retention increased. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Production models are used in fisheries when only a time series of catch and abundance indices are available. Observation-error estimators are commonly used to fit the models to the data with a least squares type of objective function. An assumption associated with observation-error estimators is that errors occur only in the observed abundance index but not in the dynamics of stock and observed catch. This assumption is usually unrealistic. Because the least squares methods tend to be sensitive to error assumptions, results derived from these methods may be unreliable. In this study, we propose a robust observation-error estimator. We evaluate the performance of this method, together with the commonly used maximum likelihood method, under different error assumptions. When there was only observation error in the abundance index, maximum likelihood tended to perform better. However, with both observation and process errors, maximum likelihood yielded much larger estimation errors compared with the proposed method. This study suggests that the proposed method is robust to error assumptions. Because the magnitude and types of error cannot often be specified with confidence, the proposed method offers a potentially useful addition to methods used to fit production models to abundance index and catch data.},

abstract = {MARSS is a package for fitting mul-tivariate autoregressive state-space models to time-series data. The MARSS package implements state-space models in a maximum likelihood framework. The core functionality of MARSS is based on likelihood maximization using the Kalman filter/smoother, combined with an EM algorithm. To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct search routines available in 'optim'. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified (such as fixed or shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package provides bootstrap routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals, and multiple options for calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC). The MARSS package (Holmes et al., 2012) is an R package for fitting linear multivariate autoregres-sive state-space (MARSS) models with Gaussian errors to time-series data. This class of model is extremely important in the study of linear stochas-tic dynamical systems, and these models are used in many different fields, including economics, engineering , genetics, physics and ecology. The model class has different names in different fields; some common names are dynamic linear models (DLMs) and vector autoregressive (VAR) state-space models. There are a number of existing R packages for fitting this class of models, including sspir (Deth-lefsen et al., 2009) for univariate data and dlm (Petris, 2010), dse (Gilbert, 2009), KFAS (Helske, 2011) and FKF (Luethi et al., 2012) for multivari-ate data. Additional packages are available on other platforms, such as SsfPack (Durbin and Koop-man, 2001), EViews (www.eviews.com) and Brodgar (www.brodgar.com). Except for Brodgar and sspir, these packages provide maximization of the likelihood surface (for maximum-likelihood parameter estimation) via quasi-Newton or Nelder-Mead type algorithms. The MARSS package was developed to provide an alternative maximization algorithm, based instead on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and to provide a standardized model-specification framework for fitting different model structures. The MARSS package was originally developed for researchers analyzing data in the natural and environmental sciences, because many of the problems often encountered in these fields are not commonly encountered in disciplines like engineering or finance.

Based on continuous monitoring data\ncollected from 2000 to 2007, we used a variable selection procedure to\nconstruct statistical generalized linear models to describe the\nrelationship between DO levels and DOD and several potentially important\npredictor variables at three spatial scales: the entire sampled area of\nthe ARB; individual water management units (WMUs) or subunits (WMSs);\nand individual sampling sites.

WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework.},

The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables.

Here, we used model selection based on information theory to measure changes in body mass over the lifespan of wild meerkats, and compared the relative fits of several standard growth models (monomolecular, von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, logistic and Richards). We found that meerkats exhibit monomolecular growth, with the best model incorporating separate growth rates before and after nutritional independence, as well as effects of season and total rainfall in the previous nine months. Our study demonstrates how simple growth curves may be improved by considering life history and environmental factors, which may be particularly relevant when quantifying growth patterns in wild populations.},

Much attention has been paid to lattice-type networks, such as patch-based metapopulations, but interest in understanding ecological networks of alternative geometries is building. Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) include some increasingly threatened ecological systems, such as caves and streams. The restrictive architecture of dendritic ecological networks might have overriding implications for species persistence. I used a modeling approach to investigate how number and spatial arrangement of habitat patches influence metapopulation extinction risk in 2 DENs of different size and topology. Metapopulation persistence was higher in larger networks, but this relationship was mediated by network topology and the dispersal pathways used to navigate the network. Larger networks, especially those with greater topological complexity, generally had lower extinction risk than smaller and less-complex networks, but dispersal bias and magnitude affected the shape of this relationship. Applying these general results to real systems will require empirical data on the movement behavior of organisms and will improve our understanding of the implications of network complexity on population and community patterns and processes},

abstract = {Mycoleptodiscus terrestris has potential as an inundative biological control agent for the management of hydrilla, one of the world's worst aquatic weeds. Essential to producing a marketable bioherbicidal product was the development of liquid culture procedures that would yield propagules that maintained biocontrol efficacy. Since M. terrestris did not produce conidia in liquid culture, various nutritional conditions were evaluated as a means to produce high concentrations of stable fungal propagules such as microsclerotia. Evaluations of propagule formation and biomass yield were carried out in liquid culture media containing a basal salts solution amended with corn steep liquor powder or cottonseed meal combined with 4% or 6% glucose. Hyphal aggregation was observed by day 2, and by day 8 abundant melanized microsclerotia were present in the broth cultures. When applied as a liquid inoculum to hydrilla at rates of 0.1 and 0.2 ml/l, the microsclerotial matrix was capable of significantly reducing hydrilla shoot biomass by as much as 99%. Air-dried microsclerotia were capable of hyphal germination in 24 h and sporogenic germination in 72 h. These capabilities have significance for the use of microsclerotia of M. terrestris as the preferred inoculum for biocontrol purposes. Hyphae germinating from microsclerotia on hydrilla plant surfaces can establish initial infection sites followed several days later by secondary infections resulting from the development and release of spores from the surface of the microsclerotia. The capability of microsclerotia of M. terrestris to remain stable as a dry preparation and to germinate both hyphally and sporogenically upon rehydration enhances the potential of this fungus for use as a nonchemical, biological control agent for hydrilla. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess, "given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species--the subject matter of community ecology--are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal to drive community dynamics.},

abstract = {Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic, interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human elements. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences. Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective academic-practitioner collaborations.},

abstract = {Widespread expansion of shrubs is occurring across the Arctic. Shrub expansion will substantially alter arctic wildlife habitats. Identifying which wildlife species are most affected by shrubification is central to predicting future arctic community composition. Through meta-analysis, we synthesized the published evidence for effects of canopy-forming shrubs on birds and mammals in the Arctic and Subarctic. We examined variation in species behaviour, distribution and population dynamics in birds and mammals in response to shrub cover (including shrub cover indicators such as shrub occurrence, extent, density and height). We also assessed the degree of heterogeneity in wildlife responses to shrub cover and synthesized the remaining literature that did not fit the criteria for our quantitative meta-analyses. Species from higher green vegetation biomass habitats (high Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI, across their distribution) were more likely to respond positively to shrub cover, demonstrating the potential for species to expand from boreal to arctic habitats under shrubification. Wildlife populations located in the lowest vegetation biomass (low NDVI) areas of their species' range had the greatest proportion of positive responses to shrub cover, highlighting how increases in performance at leading edges of invaders distributions may be particularly rapid. This demonstrates the need to study species at these leading edges to accurately predict expansion potential. Arctic specialists were poorly represented across studies (limited to 5 bird and 0 mammal species), this knowledge gap potentially explains the few reported negative effects of shrub cover (3 of 29 species). Species responses to shrub cover showed substantial heterogeneity and varied among sites and years in all studies with sufficient replication to detect such variation. Our study highlights the importance of responses at species range edges in determining outcomes of shrubification for arctic birds and mammals and the need for greater examination of potential wildlife losers under shrubification.},

abstract = {Management strategies that track time-varying productivity may better achieve management objectives than those that assume constant productivity. In Canada, biological assessments of Pacific salmon populations use upper and lower benchmarks to delineate three zones of status, green, amber and red, representing increasing probability of extirpation, reduced production, and possible increases in management intervention. Although benchmarks that track changes in productivity based on stock-recruitment relationships have been evaluated in closed-loop simulation models, benchmarks for data-limited populations that do not use recruitment relationships have not. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of lower benchmarks for data-limited populations derived from a percentile of observed spawner time-series, against those derived from data-intensive methods, using a closed-loop simulation model that included temporal changes in stock productivity. We also evaluated the role of assumptions about metapopulation dynamics and outcome uncertainty (uncertainty from the outcomes of implementing harvest management decisions) on the relative performance of lower benchmarks. Our results suggest caution when applying percentile-based benchmarks to harvest management decision rules due to high probabilities of extirpation especially when productivity is declining and outcomes of management actions are uncertain. We further provide a risk assessment framework for evaluating probabilities of extirpation of candidate benchmarks and possible trade-offs associated with harvest opportunities.},

abstract = {Overdispersion is a common feature of models of biological data, but researchers often fail to model the excess variation driving the overdispersion, resulting in biased parameter estimates and standard errors. Quantifying and modeling overdispersion when it is present is therefore critical for robust biological inference. One means to account for overdispersion is to add an observation-level random effect (OLRE) to a model, where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that can absorb the extra-parametric variation in the data. Although some studies have investigated the utility of OLRE to model overdispersion in Poisson count data, studies doing so for Binomial proportion data are scarce. Here I use a simulation approach to investigate the ability of both OLRE models and Beta-Binomial models to recover unbiased parameter estimates in mixed effects models of Binomial data under various degrees of overdispersion. In addition, as ecologists often fit random intercept terms to models when the random effect sample size is low (<5 levels), I investigate the performance of both model types under a range of random effect sample sizes when overdispersion is present. Simulation results revealed that the efficacy of OLRE depends on the process that generated the overdispersion; OLRE failed to cope with overdispersion generated from a Beta-Binomial mixture model, leading to biased slope and intercept estimates, but performed well for overdispersion generated by adding random noise to the linear predictor. Comparison of parameter estimates from an OLRE model with those from its corresponding Beta-Binomial model readily identified when OLRE were performing poorly due to disagreement between effect sizes, and this strategy should be employed whenever OLRE are used for Binomial data to assess their reliability. Beta-Binomial models performed well across all contexts, but showed a tendency to underestimate effect sizes when modelling non-Beta-Binomial data. Finally, both OLRE and Beta-Binomial models performed poorly when models contained <5 levels of the random intercept term, especially for estimating variance components, and this effect appeared independent of total sample size. These results suggest that OLRE are a useful tool for modelling overdispersion in Binomial data, but that they do not perform well in all circumstances and researchers should take care to verify the robustness of parameter estimates of OLRE models.},

abstract = {The dynamics of and policies governing spatially coupled social-ecological mosaics are considered for the case of fisheries in a lake district. A microeconomic model of households addresses agent decisions at three hierarchic levels: (1) selection of the lake district from among a larger set of alternative places to live or visit, (2) selection of a base location within the lake district, and (3) selection of a portfolio of ecosystem services to use. Ecosystem services are represented by dynamics of fish production subject to multiple stable domains and trophic cascades. Policy calculations show that optimal policies will be highly heterogeneous in space and fluid in time. The diversity of possible outcomes is illustrated by simulations for a hypothetical lake district based loosely on the Northern Highlands of the State of Wisconsin. Lake districts are frequently managed as if lakes were independent, similar, endogenously regulating systems. Our findings contradict that view. One-size-fits-all (OSFA) policies erode ecological and social resilience. If regulations are too stringent, social resilience declines because of the potential rewards of overharvesting. If regulations are too lax, ecological resilience is diminished by overharvesting in some lakes. In either case, local collapses of fish populations evoke spatial shifts of angling effort that can lead to serial collapses in neighboring fisheries and degraded fisheries in most or all of the lakes. Under OSFA management, the natural resources of the entire landscape become more vulnerable to transformation because of changes in, e.g., human population, the demand for resources, or fish harvesting technology. Multiplicity of management regimes can increase the ecological resilience, social resilience, and inclusive value of a spatially heterogeneous social-ecological system. Because of the complex interactions of mobile people and multistable ecosystems, management regimes must also be flexible over time. A rights-based scheme may facilitate policy regimes with appropriate spatial patterns and intertemporal fluidity. In lake fisheries, habitat protection adds an important dimension to policy design. Habitat is a slowly changing variable that creates ecological resilience and thereby provides managers with a broader range of options.},

In many locations, MPAs have generated positive effects on fish communities, but the impacts of fishing pressure—the primary stressor MPAs seek to manage—have not been well investigated. We examined changes in fish biomass inside and outside of no-take MPAs over 14 years in central California, USA. Using data from the community-based science program, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program, we tested which environmental and human-induced stressors most influence the strength of MPA responses. While temperature and productivity were included in the best fit model, we found that fine-scale fishing effort data, following reserve implementation, best explained the spatial variation in fish community responses to MPAs. Specifically, differences in fish biomass between MPAs and sites open to fishing were larger for reserves near heavily fished locations and these areas exhibited the highest rate of change in fish biomass, indicating strong positive effects of the MPA on the most heavily exploited fish communities. As MPAs continue to be used as a prominent conservation strategy in coastal systems, managers should consider both the suite of human-induced (socio-ecological interactions) and environmental conditions that may alter MPA success as well as establish long-term monitoring programs to fully assess the functionality of marine reserves into the future.},

abstract = {Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control excessive and nuisance levels of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). At times, these applications tend to be more effective at the onset of fish spawning in spring; however, they can cause conflicts between anglers and lake management personnel assigned to control excessive SAV. We evaluated the direct application of an aquatic herbicide (Aquathol K [dipotassium salt of endothall]) on the nest behavior and fidelity of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and measured the subsequent reproductive success of these fish. Endothall was applied to achieve a shoreline concentration of 5 mg/L of water volume in 0.1-ha ponds (3 mg/L whole-pond concentration). It was applied directly on nests in three ponds in March 2005, 2006, and 2007 when largemouth bass initiated spawning; spawning activity was monitored over 1415 d. Using similar techniques, we applied water to another three ponds where largemouth bass were nesting. For all 3 years, endothall did not affect nest guarding by largemouth bass, and nest fidelity was similar to that for ponds treated with water. Endothall concentrations declined about sevenfold over 21 d but persisted in the water during spawning. Electrofishing of young largemouth bass 23 months after spawning showed that their relative abundance and size were similar among the ponds treated with endothall and the control ponds. Similarly, the density and biomass of age-0 largemouth bass did not vary between treatments for fish killed with rotenone in late August each year. Managers can use these results to address angler concerns about endothall application during largemouth bass spawning and thereby lessen conflicts over efforts to control excessive SAV.},

By fitting a population model to empirical data, we show that sea otters had the greatest impact on the mortality of large sea urchins, but that Pycnopodia decline corresponded to a 311% increase in medium urchins and a 30% decline in kelp densities. Our results reveal that predator complementarity in size-selective prey consumption strengthens top-down control on urchins, affecting the resilience of alternative reef states by reinforcing the resilience of kelp forests and eroding the resilience of urchin barrens. We reveal previously underappreciated species interactions within a 'classic' trophic cascade and regime shift, highlighting the critical role of middle-level predators in mediating rocky reef state transitions.},

We use this model to show how the energy demands for both growth and reproduction trade off to determine optimal life-history traits. Assuming that both age at maturity and reproductive investment adapt to variations in adult mortality to maximize lifetime offspring production, our model predicts that: (i) the optimal age of maturity is inversely related to adult mortality rate; (ii) the optimal reproductive effort is approximately equal to adult mortality rate. These predictions are consistent with observed variations in the life-history traits of a large sample of iteroparous freshwater fishes.},

abstract = {A prominent response of temperate aquatic ecosystems to climate warming is changes in phenology advancements or delays in annually reoccurring events in an organism's life cycle. The exact seasonal timing of warming, in conjunction with species-specific life-history events such as emergence from resting stages, timing of spawning, generation times, or stage-specific prey requirements, may determine the nature of a species' response. We demonstrate that recent climate-induced shifts in the phenology of lake phytoplankton and zooplankton species in a temperate eutrophic lake (M{\"{u}}ggelsee, Germany) differed according to differences in their characteristic life cycles. Fastgrowing plankton in spring (diatoms, Daphnia) showed significant and synchronous forward movements by about 1 month, induced by concurrent earlier ice break-up dates (diatoms) and higher spring water temperature (Daphnia). No such synchrony was observed for slow-growing summer zooplankton species with longer and more complex life cycles (copepods, larvae of the mussel Dreissena polymorpha). Although coexisting, the summer plankton responded species specifically to seasonal warming trends, depending on whether the timing of warming matched their individual thermal requirements at decisive developmental stages such as emergence from diapause (copepods), or spawning (Dreissena). Others did not change their phenology significantly, but nevertheless, increased in abundances. We show that the detailed seasonal pattern of warming influences the response of phyto- and zooplankton species to climate change, and point to the diverse nature of responses for species exhibiting complex life-history traits. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This article reviews published research that has focused on the recreational fishing site choices made by anglers. A conceptual model for predicting fishing site choice is developed by synthesizing the findings from past studies that employed fishing site choice models. From these and other relevant studies, six general attributes (i.e., costs, fishing quality, environmental quality, facility development, encounters with other anglers, and regulations) are identified that may influence an angler's selection of a fishing site. The article also enhances the conceptual model by accounting for differing preferences among anglers, for complex substitution patterns among fishing sites, for fishing participation decisions, for habit forming behaviors and for differences in anglers' awareness levels for fishing sites. Finally, the article discusses several avenues that researchers could exploit to improve on past fishing site choice model studies},

abstract = {Species responses to climate change are often measured at broad spatiotemporal scales, which can miss the fine-scale changes that are most relevant to conservation and fisheries management. We develop a scaleable geostatistical approach to assess how juvenile and adult fish distributions have been shaped by changes in bottom temperature and dissolved oxygen over a recent decade of warming in the northeast Pacific. Across 38 demersal fishes, biomass trends were associated negatively with warming and positively with dissolved oxygen, but when trends in both biomass and climate were converted to velocities—the speed and direction a population would have to move to maintain consistent conditions—the effect of temperature change differed depending on local conditions. In the warmest locations, warming velocities were associated with negative biotic velocities for 19 of 69 species-maturity combinations, and yet were almost always associated with stable or positive biotic velocities in the coolest locations (64 of 69). These spatially consistent biomass declines (negative biotic velocities) in the warmest locations and increases in cooler locations suggest a redistribution of species with the potential for new ecological and fisheries interactions. After controlling for temperature, the more spatially consistent effects of dissolved oxygen were often negative, suggesting a mechanism other than hypoxia avoidance—potentially changes in primary production. Our approach identifies the species and locations that are most sensitive to observed changes in the environment at any scale, thus facilitating future vulnerability assessments.},

However, small pelagics are difficult to survey directly, so we developed a novel method of assessing the aggregate abundance of 21 small pelagic forage taxa via predator stomach contents. We used stomach contents collected from 22 piscivore species captured by multiple bottom trawl surveys within a vector autoregressive spatio-temporal model to assess trends of small pelagics on the Northeast US shelf. The goal was to develop a spatial “forage index” to inform survey and (or) fishery availability in the western North Atlantic bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix) stock assessment. This spatially resolved index compared favorably with more traditional design-based survey biomass indices for forage species well sampled by surveys. However, our stomach content-based index better represented smaller unmanaged forage species that surveys are not designed to capture. The stomach-based forage index helped explain bluefish availability to the recreational fishery for stock assessment and provided insight into pelagic forage trends throughout the regional ecosystem.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity can combine with evolutionary responses to create very dynamic and often locally independent populations across a landscape. Such complexity creates difficulties for managers trying to conserve populations across large areas. This study develops, applies, and tests the use of stochastic life- history modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess management scenarios related to the realities of regional fisheries management and conservation. We apply this approach to the manage- ment of recreational brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) fishing; an activity that can severely impact species balance, abundance, and the size structure of fish communities. Specifically, the model incorporates population- specific life- history information (e.g., growth rate, repro- ductive effort, and survival) to allow forecasts of the impact of various management strate- gies and/or changes to environmental conditions on a population's ecological characteristics (e.g., size structure, abundance, and probability of persistence). Sampling was carried out in 16 water bodies spread across four sites in Atlantic Canada. Each water body was sampled in 2005 and reassessed in 2008. This sampling had two primary objectives: (1) define a significant proportion of life- history variation of brook trout in Atlantic Canada, and (2) to test the precision and accuracy of model predictions of population responses to experimental exploitation and management changes. The model successfully predicted population responses to changes in adult survival in 12 of 13 populations having sufficient data for validation testing, while also proving to be a useful tool when engaging stake- holders regarding management options and their associated risk. We suggest that such models are cost- effective and have great potential for informing proactive management of jurisdictions},

This study develops critical reference points for sustainable management by using a large empirical dataset on the coral reefs of the western Indian Ocean to investigate associations between levels of target fish biomass (as an indicator of fishing intensity) and eight metrics of ecosystem state. These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures. Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable yield (B(MMSY)). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries, we found that unregulated fisheries often operate below the B(MMSY), whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted fisheries were within or above this window. These findings provide tangible management targets for multispecies coral reef fisheries and highlight key tradeoffs required to achieve different fisheries and conservation goals.},

abstract = {The delineation of conservation units (CUs) is a challenging issue that has profound implications forminimizing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. CU delineation typically seeks to prioritize evolutionary significance, and genetic methods play a pivotal role in the delineation process by quantifying overall differentiation between populations. Although CUs that primarily reflect overall genetic differentiation do protect adaptive differences between distant populations, they do not necessarily protect adaptive variation within highly connected populations. Advances in genomic methodology facilitate the characterization of adaptive genetic variation, but the potential utility of this information for CU delineation is unclear. We use genomic methods to investigate the evolutionary basis of premature migration in Pacific salmon, a complex behavioral and physiological phenotype that exists within highly connected populations and has experienced severe declines. Strikingly, we find that prematuremigration is associated with the same single locus across multiple populations in each of two different species. Patterns of variation at this locus suggest that the premature migration alleles arose froma single evolutionary eventwithin each species and were subsequently spread to distant populations through straying and positive selection. Our results reveal that complex adaptive variation can depend on rare mutational events at a single locus, demonstrate that CUs reflecting overall genetic differentiation can fail to protect evolutionarily significant variation that has substantial ecological and societal benefits, and suggest that a supplemental framework for protecting specific adaptive variation will sometimes be necessary to prevent the loss of significant biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Considerable research has highlighted the important role of anadromous salmon in importing marine-derived nutrients to freshwater and riparian ecosystems. These subsidies are thought to support diverse food webs and increase the growth and survival of juvenile salmon during their freshwater residency. Quite recently, however, salmon smolts have been identified as important exporters of nutrients from freshwater ecosystems. Using a mass-balance approach, we examined the phosphorus-transport dynamics by spring/summer Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River basin and estimated that net phosphorus transport into the basin over the past 40 years was < 2% of historical levels. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship existed between nutrient import by adults and subsequent export by smolts, such that smolts exported proportionally more phosphorus as spawner abundance decreased. In 12% of years, smolts exported more than adults imported, resulting in a net loss of phosphorus from the ecosystem. This loss of marine subsidies may have caused a state shift in the productivity of the freshwater ecosystem, resulting in strong density-dependent survival observed in juvenile salmon. These results suggest that conserving this threatened stock of salmon requires the need to explicitly address the important role of marine-derived nutrients and energy in sustaining salmon populations.},

In Canada, access to marine resources and ocean spaces is a significant issue for many coastal and Indigenous communities due to intensifying activity and competition in the marine environment. The general trend of loss of access has implications for these communities, and for Canadian society. In this review and policy perspective, we argue that access for coastal and Indigenous communities should be a priority consideration in all policies and decision-making processes related to fisheries and the ocean in Canada. This paper reviews how access affects the well-being of coastal communities, factors that support or undermine access, and research priorities to inform policy. Recommended actions include: ensuring access is transparently considered in all ocean-related decisions; supporting research to fill knowledge gaps on access to enable effective responses; making data accessible and including communities in decision-making that grants or restricts access to adjacent marine resources and spaces; ensuring updated laws, policies and planning processes explicitly incorporate access considerations; and, identifying and prioritizing actions to maintain and increase access. Taking action now could reverse the current trend and ensure that coastal and Indigenous communities thrive in the future. This is not just a Canadian issue. Globally, the ability of coastal and Indigenous communities to access and benefit from the marine environment should be at the forefront in all deliberations related to the oceans.},

Previous estimates of straying have been confounded by various factors influencing the probability of individuals returning to non-natal sites (e.g., off-station releases), whereas analyses undertaken here of nearly a quarter million coded-wire tag recoveries control for these factors. Our results revealed large and generally consistent differences in the propensity to stray among species, life history types within species, and populations. Paired releases indicated that (i) Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) strayed more (mean population range 0.11%-34.6%) than coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) (0.08%-0.94%); (ii) ocean-type Chinook (5.2%-18.6%) strayed more than stream-type Chinook (0.11%-10%); and Chinook salmon (0.90%-54.9%) strayed more than steelhead (0.30%-2.3%).

@article{Thorson2014a,
abstract = {Spatial, phenotypic and genetic diversity at relatively small scales can buffer species against large-scale processes such as climate change that tend to synchronize populations and increase temporal variability in overall abundance or production. This portfolio effect generally results in improved biological and economic outcomes for managed species. Previous evidence for the portfolio effect in salmonids has arisen from examinations of time series of adult abundance, but we lack evidence of spatial buffering of temporal variability in demographic rates such as survival of juveniles during their first year of life. We therefore use density-dependent population models with multiple random effects to represent synchronous (similar among populations) and asynchronous (different among populations) temporal variability as well as spatial variability in survival. These are fitted to 25 years of survey data for breeding adults and surviving juveniles from 15 demographically distinct populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within a single metapopulation in the Snake River in Idaho, USA. Model selection identifies the most support for the model that included both synchronous and asynchronous temporal variability, in addition to spatial variability. Asynchronous variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}55) is approximately equal in magnitude to synchronous temporal variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}67), but much lower than spatial variability (log-SD = 1{\textperiodcentered}11). We also show that the pairwise correlation coefficient, a common measure of population synchrony, is approximated by the estimated ratio of shared and total variance, where both approaches yield a synchrony estimate of 0{\textperiodcentered}59. We therefore find evidence for spatial buffering of temporal variability in early juvenile survival, although between-population variability that persists over time is also large. We conclude that spatial variation decreases interannual changes in overall juvenile production, which suggests that conservation and restoration of spatial diversity will improve population persistence for this metapopulation. However, the exact magnitude of spatial buffering depends upon demographic parameters such as adult survival that may vary among populations and is proposed as an area of future research using hierarchical life cycle models. We recommend that future sampling of this metapopulation employ a repeated-measure sampling design to improve estimation of early juvenile carrying capacity. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

This textbook provides a new framework for natural resource managementa framework based on stewardship of ecosystems for ecological integrity and human well-being in a world dominated by uncertainty and change. The goal of ecosystem stewardship is to respond to and shape changes in social-ecological systems in order to sustain the supply and availability of ecosystem services by society. The book links recent advances in the theory of resilience, sustainability, and vulnerability with practical issues of ecosystem management and governance. Chapters by leading experts then illustrate these principles in major social-ecological systems of the world. Inclusion of review questions, glossary, and suggestions for additional reading makes Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship: Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in a Changing World particularly suitable for use in all courses of resource management, resource ecology, sustainability science, and the human dimensions of global change. Professional resource managers, policy makers, leaders of NGOs, and researchers will find this novel synthesis a valuable tool in developing strategies for a more sustainable planet.

abstract = {Residuals associated with catch-curve regressions can represent variable recruitment in fish populations. Catch curves are used to estimate steady-state mortality and assume relatively constant recruitment, but this assumption is rarely met. I documented the presence of abundant year classes of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), from earlier sampling and these dominant year classes persisted over time in two reservoirs. I expanded simple linear catch-curve regressions that used age (in years) as an independent regressor to multiple regression models each of which incorporated an additional independent environmental variable (ENVIR) that was measured when fish were age 0. The age term in the regression was proportionally weighted to the sample Size at each age which deflated the influence of older and rarer fish in the analysis. This generalized regression equation: log($\epsilon$) (NUMBER) = b0-b1 CAGE) ± b2 (ENVIR); explained variable abundance-at-age (NUMBER) and the environmental term was related to the formation of weak and strong year classes after accounting for the effects of age. Typically; age will explain the majority (r2> 0.5)of the variation in abundance-at-age. For two largemouth bass populations, environmental hydraulic variables were significant (P < 0.10) terms in this equation and explained an additional 12 and 16% of the variation in number after accounting for the variation explained by age. For data collected in one population 2 yrs after the initial analysis, the same strong and weak year classes persisted, residuals from these catch curves were correlated (r = 0.86, P < 0.05, N = 6), and the influence of hydrology on year class formation was duplicated. This approach can provide savings in labor and funds as abundance of young fish or recruitment indices do not have to be measured each year.},

abstract = {The potential influence of climate change on the future distribution and abundance of fish (and therefore commercial fisheries and food security) is increasingly recognized in the fishery management community. A changing climate will likely have differing effects on different species; some will flourish, some will flounder. Management targets for fishing mortality and spawning biomass are often calculated by assuming stationary population processes, but under climate change, this assumption may be violated. Non-stationary population processes can introduce bias into estimates of biomass from stock assessments and calculations of target fishing mortalities and biomasses. However, few accepted frameworks exist for incorporating the changing influence of the environment on exploited populations into management strategies. Identifying changes in population processes due to environmental influences is important in order to enable climate-enhanced management strategy evaluations to elucidate the potential benefits and costs of changing management targets. Cost/benefit analyses will also be useful when coincidentally caught species respond differently to environmental change.},

abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social– ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components—latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy—most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.},

abstract = {A field comparison of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) and prawn (shrimp) trawls was made to assess the sampling options for describing patterns of fish biodiversity in the lagoonal waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Replicated comparisons were made during the day and night on trawl grounds with different biophysical characteristics. Each trawl was made close and parallel to a long-shore set of five BRUVS set at regular intervals along one nautical mile. For each species, the sum of the maximum number of fish sighted on BRUVS at any one time (∑MaxN1, ..., 5) was compared with the number of fish caught in trawls (N). The two techniques recorded significantly different components of the fish fauna on the trawl grounds. Trawls caught mainly small (≤300 mm), sedentary or cryptic, demersal species - such as flatfishes, apogonids, synodontids, triglids and callionymids. The BRUVS recorded more larger, mobile species from a much wider size range of families, including large elasmobranchs, more fusiform pelagic species (such as carangids and scombrids), and numerous eels. Species accumulation curves were parallel and very similar in shape for both techniques, but were separated by about 11 extra species in trawls. Fifty-two species in 17 families were caught only in trawls and 38 species in 15 families were recorded only by BRUVS. The occurrence of 38 small mobile species in 21 families was common to both techniques, but most of these showed marked differences in relative abundance. Trawls recorded higher species richness at all sites, and at night, but the average number of species and individuals recorded per transect were only about 26% and 19% lower for the BRUVS. The BRUVS consistently recorded more species during the day than trawls, and are limited most by water clarity. Multivariate analyses showed that both techniques indicated the presence of six fish assemblages based on day and night in three locations, despite sampling quite different components of the fauna. The six assemblages accounted for 78.9% of the variation in the BRUVS data compared to 68.9% of the variation in the trawl data, and there was a lower error rate in discriminating the six assemblages in the BRUVS data. BRUVS are non-extractive and can be used on complex topographies and in sensitive habitats in most or all zones of the Marine Park, but models of bait plumes are needed to convert fish sightings to density estimates. They may have a particular role in studies of larger, rarer elasmobranchs and teleosts of special conservation interest. Trawls can be used in any level of water clarity and provide direct estimates of fish density, particularly those smaller teleosts most vulnerable to the effects of trawling. The complementary use of prawn trawls and BRUVS would enable a more comprehensive assessment of teleost and elasmobranch diversity in the variety of inter-reef seabed topographies and management zones comprising the Marine Park.

In five well-studied ecosystems, we found that fishing these species at conventional maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels can have large impacts on other parts of the ecosystem, particularly when they constitute a high proportion of the biomass in the ecosystem or are highly connected in the food web. Halving exploitation rates would result in much lower impacts on marine ecosystems while still achieving 80% of MSY.},

abstract = {Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery in the ocean. However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.},

abstract = {Predation can be intense, creating strong direct and indirect effects throughout food webs. In addition, ecologists increasingly recognize that fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can have major consequences for community dynamics. Species with complex life histories often shift habitats during their life cycles and provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems. Thus, local interactions that affect predator abundance in one ecosystem (for example a larval habitat) may have reverberating effects in another (for example an adult habitat). Here we show that fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction through cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances in ponds, leading to fewer adult dragonflies nearby. Adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators and alter their foraging behaviour. As a result, plants near ponds with fish receive more pollinator visits and are less pollen limited than plants near fish-free ponds. Our results confirm that strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of landscape-level processes in driving local species interactions.},

abstract = {Abstract New approaches are required to undertake the substantial task of monitoring ongoing fishing activity in marine conservation areas to ensure conservation goals are achieved. To address this need, we applied previously developed, yet currently underused, vessel tracking methods based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) and aerial surveillance (?flyovers?) to Canada's Pacific marine conservation areas from 2012 to 2019. We used satellite and terrestrial-based AIS receivers and flyover-based visual observations to estimate illegal and legal fishing activity after 185 conservation area (CA) enactments (i.e., static, geographically defined areas with fishing regulations). We compared the effectiveness in detecting fishing activity between the AIS- and flyover-based methods, and used the latter to determine that 93% of vessels were actively fishing in CAs without AIS. The AIS-based method still detected 3303?h of fishing in CAs after enactment, and both methods estimated 22%?24% of fishing activity in CAs was illegal. The application of these methods also shed light on the complexity of fishing regulations across CAs (i.e., varying and CA-specific restrictions). This highlighted the need to better align vessel tracking fishing gear classifications with CA regulation specifications, and conversely to simplify regulations (e.g., no-take), for more accurate monitoring and evaluation moving forward.},

Methods are provided for determining fish density and size, identifying species, and measuring swimming speed and successful applications of previous surveys of fish under the ice are described. These include drilling ice holes, selecting batteries and generators, deploying pan and tilt cameras, and using paired colored lasers to determine fish size and habitat associations. We also discuss use of infrared and white light to enhance image-capturing capabilities, deployment of digital recording systems and time-lapse techniques, and the use of imaging software. Data are presented from initial surveys with video and acoustic cameras in the Sagavanirktok River Delta, Alaska, during late winter 2004. These surveys represent the first known successful application of a dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON TM ) acoustic camera under the ice that achieved fish detection and sizing at camera ranges up to 16 m. Feasibility tests of video and acoustic cameras for determining fish size and density at various turbidity levels are also presented. Comparisons are made of the different techniques in terms of suitability for achieving various fisheries research objectives. This information is intended to assist researchers in choosing the equipment that best meets their study needs.},

We propose a conceptual typology of six organizing principles of CAS based on a comparison of leading scholars' classifications of CAS features and properties. This typology clusters together similar underlying organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses normative challenges for problem-oriented researchers and practitioners taking on real-world challenges.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Under accelerating threats from climate-change impacts, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed as climate-adaptation tools to enhance the resilience of marine ecosystems. Yet, debate persists as to whether and how MPAs may promote resilience to climate shocks. Here, we use 38?years of satellite-derived kelp cover to empirically test whether a network of 58 temperate coastal MPAs in Central and Southern California enhances the resistance of kelp forest ecosystems to, and their recovery from, the unprecedented 2014?2016 marine heatwave regime that occurred in the region. We also leverage a 22-year time series of subtidal community surveys to mechanistically understand whether trophic cascades explain emergent patterns in kelp forest resilience within MPAs. We find that fully protected MPAs significantly enhance kelp forests' resistance to and recovery from marine heatwaves in Southern California, but not in Central California. Differences in regional responses to the heatwaves are partly explained by three-level trophic interactions comprising kelp, urchins, and predators of urchins. Urchin densities in Southern California MPAs are lower within fully protected MPAs during and after the heatwave, while the abundances of their main predators?lobster and sheephead?are higher. In Central California, a region without lobster or sheephead, there is no significant difference in urchin or kelp densities within MPAs as the current urchin predator, the sea otter, is protected statewide. Our analyses show that fully protected MPAs can be effective climate-adaptation tools, but their ability to enhance resilience to extreme climate events depends upon region-specific environmental and trophic interactions. As nations progress to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030, scientists and managers should consider whether protection will increase resilience to climate-change impacts given their local ecological contexts, and what additional measures may be needed.},

We first review published data and give new results showing that key reference points are fixed when steepness and other life history parameters are fixed in stock assessments using a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship. We use both production and age-structured models to explore these patterns. For the production model, we derive explicit relationships for steepness and life history parameters and then for steepness and major reference points. For the age-structured model, we are required to generally use numerical computation, and so we provide an example that complements the analytical results of the production model. We discuss what it means to set steepness equal to 1 and how to construct a prior for steepness. Ways out of the difficult situation raised by fixing steepness and life history parameters include not fixing them, using a more complicated stock-recruitment relationship, and being more explicit about the information content of the data and what that means for policy makers. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach.},

abstract = {Aquatic plants mediate ecological processes in aquatic habitats, specifically predator–prey (bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque)- macroinvertebrate) interactions. Macroinvertebrate colonization is directly and indirectly influenced by substrate heterogeneity, interstitial space, and surface complexity. Exotic invasive plant species, such as Hydrilla verticillata L.F. Royle, may alter the available structure in aquatic habitat by creating a shift to a homogeneous habitat, thus affecting the macroinvertebrate community. Since macroinvertebrates provide a food base for young phytophilic fishes, changes in their density and abundance may alter food webs. We investigated the hypothesis that macroinvertebrate community structure is influenced by differences in habitat heterogeneity by measuring difference between a heterogeneous native aquatic plant bed, homogenous hydrilla plant bed, and habitat with no plants. Studies were conducted in the field (pond) and the experimental treatments were: (1) no plants, (2) monotypic bed of hydrilla, and (3) diverse native plants. Aquatic plants, regardless of species, supported greater macroinvertebrate abundance, richness, and biomass. Macroinvertebrate abundance, richness, and biomass in a hydrilla-dominated habitat did not differ significantly from a diverse plant habitat, except for richness in October. Indicator taxa did differ significantly between respective treatments, suggesting a change in species composition. However, no significant effect of fish predation on macroinvertebrate populations and/or community structure was documented. The data suggest that a shift from a natural mosaic of vegetated habitat to a highly complex monotypic habitat (e.g., exotic hydrilla) may reduce spatial heterogeneity important to structuring a macroinvertebrate assemblage.},

abstract = {Ecology has entered into a dynamic period, driven by both the urgency of large-scale ecological problems and startling new ecological findings that are being shared broadly beyond the scientific community. Both of these factors are well represented by observational approaches to ecology, which are re-emerging after a long period of deference to manipulative experimental approaches. These approaches examine ecological patterns and processes through data gathered in situations where nature has not been purposefully manipulated. The use of unmanipulated observational data reflects on the work of early naturalists, but is greatly enhanced by technological advances in remote sensing, microscopy, genetics, animal-borne sensors, and computing. Once dismissed as merely “exploratory”, strictly observational approaches to ecology have demonstrated capability in testing hypotheses by correlating variables, comparing observed patterns to output from existing models, exploiting natural experiments, and simulating experiments within large datasets. These approaches can be used in a stand-alone fashion, but are strengthened when reconciled with experimental manipulations to isolate fine-scale ecological mechanisms.},

The Ideal Free model predicts that the distribution of organisms between resource sites should match the distribution of resources. Many studies report support for this prediction. We review tests of this model utilising a method of analysis derived from the psychological principle called the matching law. Our reanalysis revealed that the distribution of organisms is consistently less extreme than the distribution of resources. This systematic deviation from the Ideal Free Distribution means organisms underuse richer sites and overuse poorer sites. We examine how deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution may arise as a consequence of discrimination constraints, competitive interactions, competitive asymmetries and travel between sites, and recommend ways in which the design of future tests of the Ideal Free Distribution may be improved.},

abstract = {We explored the social and ecological outcomes associated with emergence of a management panacea designed to govern a stochastic renewable natural resource. To that end, we constructed a model of a coupled social-ecological system of recreational fisheries in which a manager supports naturally fluctuating stocks by stocking fish in response to harvest-driven satisfaction of resource users. The realistic assumption of users remembering past harvest experiences when exploiting a stochastically fluctuating fish population facilitates the emergence of a stocking-based management panacea over time. The social benefits of panacea formation involve dampening natural population fluctuations and generating stability of user satisfaction. It also maintains the resource but promotes the eventual replacement of wild fish by hatchery-descended fish. Our analyses show this outcome is particularly likely when hatchery-descended fish are reasonably fit (e.g., characterized by similar survival relative to wild fish) and/or when natural recruitment of the wild population is low (e.g., attributable to habitat deterioration), which leaves the wild population with little buffer against competition by stocked fish. The potential for release-based panacea formation is particularly likely under user-based management regimes and should be common in a range of social-ecological systems (e.g., fisheries, forestry), whenever user groups are entitled to engage in release or replanting strategies. The net result will be the preservation of a renewable resource through user-based incentives, but the once natural populations are likely to be altered and to host nonnative genotypes. This risks other ecosystem services and the future of wild populations.},

abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to reevaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data syntheses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools.},

Among other things, the findings in the Spanish case show a complex relationship between the amount of fish landed and price; a clear substitution relationship between fresh fish and aquaculture; a negative impact oflabour costs in amanual labour-inten- sive sector such as fishing, which in developed countries is being affected by an exodus of manpower to other sectors where there is less uncertainty surrounding labour conditions; the impact ofSpain being barred from international fishing grounds a result ofthe delimitation of exclusive economic zones (EEZs); and the dwindling importance of fisheries traffic as a result of the port devolution process begun in Spain in the early 1990s.

abstract = {The life-histories of exploited fish species, such as Pacific salmon, are vulnerable to a wide variety of anthropogenic stressors including climate change, selective exploitation and competition with hatchery releases for finite foraging resources. However, these stressors may generate unexpected changes in life-histories due to developmental linkages when species complete their migratory life cycle in different habitats. We used multivariate time-series models to quantify changes in the prevalence of different life-history strategies of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past half-century—specifically, how they partition their lives between freshwater habitats and the ocean. Climate warming has decreased the time spent by salmon in their natal freshwater habitat, as climate-enhanced growth opportunities have enabled earlier migration to the ocean. Migration from freshwater at a younger age, and increasing competition from wild and hatchery-released salmon, have tended to delay maturation toward the salmon spending an additional year feeding in the ocean. Models evaluating the effects of size-selective fishing on these patterns had only small support. These stressors combine to reduce the size-at-age of fish vulnerable to commercial fisheries and have increasingly favoured a single-age class, potentially affecting the age class complexity that stabilizes this highly reliable resource. Quantifying the impact of multiple stressors on different life-history stages of sockeye salmon, the authors show that climate warming impacts the timing of migration from natal freshwater habitats, with knock-on effects for adult maturation in the ocean.},

However as seine net catches can misinform about rank order of abundances of species, its main use may be in collecting presence/absence data.

Model parameters are based on creel survey data from 53 lakes and empirical relationships between growth, survival, and density derived from whole-lake density manipulations on nine lakes over a period of 10 years. We compared angling quality, population density, fish size, and yield under unfished conditions, harvest rates that maximize sustained yields (MSY), and an IFD equilibrium driven by angler behavior. The IFD equilibrium rarely maximized yields. Stocks with high MSY angling quality are overexploited at the IFD equilibrium because anglers move to take advantage of exceptional angling opportunities. These stocks would often be viewed as more resistant to harvest pressure because they have higher stock productivities and habitat capacities. However, in our model, they are systematically overharvested because their high fish density attracts excessive angling pressure. Conversely, stocks with low MSY angling quality are underexploited because anglers move to take advantage of better angling quality on other lakes.},

We focused on the hypotheses that increased movement probabilities were in response to low food availability or low water levels; the latter also implying low food availability for this species. An alternative hypothesis was that snail kites exhibit exploratory behavior, and corresponding increased movement probabilities, during periods of high food availability. Movement probabilities were not consistent with the hypotheses that low water levels or low food availability were the proximate cues to initiate movement from one wetland to another. Movement probabilities were higher during periods of relatively high food availability and were not associated with water levels; thus were consistent with the hypothesis that snail kites exhibited exploratory behavior during times of food abundance. However, we do not believe that our results are in conflict with previous reports of increased movement during extreme food scarcity; rather, that these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and reflect different resource levels. During extreme drying events, food becomes virtually unavailable and birds must either move or die, but during times of food abundance there may be an advantage of exploratory behavior. Given that local drying events occur at frequencies of approximately every 5-10 yr in this environment, having explored wetlands throughout their range reduces the need for "blind" searching for suitable alternative habitats when such events do occur.},

Current salmon populations average 3% of 1950s–1960s abundances, which may have been 30% of precommercial fishery (1880s) populations. Notably, the SBS has influenced contemporary managers as reflected in minimum viable abundance, sustainable escapement, and adequate seeding objectives equaling 10.4%, 17.9%, and 20.4%, respectively, of 1950s–1960s potential. Our approach provides a framework for utilizing archival and contemporary data to reconstruct historical baselines and repress SBS.

abstract = {—Thermal habitat use by lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in two northern lakes in the southern portion of the Yukon Territory that differ in morphometry and thermal regime was monitored using temperature-sensitive acoustics and radiotelemetry. We then contrasted in situ temperature selection by lake trout in these lakes with previously published estimates of the species' optimal thermal range of 8–128C. We found that thermal habitat use by lake trout in the two northern lakes is not consistent with these literature-derived expectations. In Dezadeash Lake, which is isothermal in summer, temperatures typically exceeded the literature-derived upper limit of 128C. Throughout the summer lake trout sought the coldest water in the lake, which was in the form of shallow coldwater plumes derived from alpine ice-pack meltwater streams. Once lake temperatures declined in the fall, lake trout were distributed throughout the lake. In Kathleen Lake, where water temperatures ranged from approximately 28C to 128C in the summer, the majority of lake trout selected habitats throughout the summer and fall that were colder than the 88C lower limit of their literature-derived optimal thermal range. Our results highlight the importance of summer thermal refugia for lake trout inhabiting marginal systems and the variation in thermal habitat use among populations inhabiting different thermal environments. Given the established importance of thermal habitat availability to lake trout production, our results suggest the need to better understand optimal thermal habitat characteristics in nature, particularly in light of factors such as climate warming. Fish movement and distribution patterns are gov-erned by biotic and abiotic factors, as well as behavioral and life history characteristics. With few exceptions, fish are obligate ectotherms, such that environmental temperature determines body tempera-ture. Fish, however, can control thermal experience through behavioral thermoregulation. Temperate fish typically occupy systems with considerable thermal complexity, yet most inhabit a relatively narrow, species-specific thermal range that defines the optimal conditions for activity and metabolism (Magnuson et al. 1979), and fish will thermoregulate behaviorally in an effort to remain within this thermal range. Lake trout Salvelinus namaycush are a coldwater stenotherm. They normally occupy waters within a temperature range of 6–138C (Martin and Olver 1980), and it is generally assumed that temperatures greater than 15.58C are unsuitable for lake trout (MacLean et al. 1990), at least for extended periods. Assuming food availability and niche interactions are not limiting, temperatures between 88C and 128C define the physiologically optimal thermal range for activity, metabolism, and therefore, growth for this species (Christie and Regier 1988); the optimum temperature is 108C (Stewart et al. 1983; Magnuson et al. 1990). Availability of thermal habitat (thermal habitat volume) for lake trout within this temperature range has also been empirically related to production of this species (Christie and Regier 1988; Payne et al. 1990). Although limited testing of this optimum thermal range has been performed for lake trout in the field, most researchers generally apply the above thermal range to define optimal thermal habitat in the natural environment. This optimum thermal range usually has been determined through laboratory testing of juvenile lake trout, which are often hatchery reared and originate from lake trout stocks in the southern part of their range (Mac 1985; McCauley and Tait 1970; O'Connor et al. 1981). To date, rigorous field verification of juvenile and adult physiological thermal optima for more northerly stocks has not occurred. Although brief exposure of fish to temperatures that are slightly outside the boundaries of the optimal thermal range probably has little influence on overall growth, survival, or reproduction, prolonged exposure to unfavorable temperatures probably has a dramatic effect on these characteristics. When temperatures become unfavorably warm for prolonged periods, decreases in growth, survival, and reproduction are likely and local extirpation of affected populations occurs (MacLean et al. 1990). Given the importance of lake trout to commercial, sport, and subsistence fisheries, improving our understanding of how lake trout use available thermal habitat may not only shed},

abstract = {The collapse and recovery of North Sea herring in the latter half of the 20th century had both ecological and economic consequences. We review the effect of the collapse and investigate whether the increased understanding about the biology, ecology, and stock dynamics gained in the past three decades can aid management to prevent further collapses and improve projections of recovery. Recruitment adds the most uncertainty to estimates of future yield and the potential to reach biomass reference points within a specified time-frame. Stock-recruitment relationships must be viewed as being fluid and dependent on ecosystem change. Likewise, predation mortality changes over time. Management aimed at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing mortality targets implies interannual variation in TACs, and variability in supply is therefore unavoidable. Harvest control rules, when adhered to, aid management greatly. We advocate that well-founded science can substantially contribute to management through improved confidence and increased transparency. At present, we cannot predict the effects of collapse or recovery of a single stock on the ecosystem as a whole. Moreover, as managers try to reconcile commitments to single-species MSY targets with the ecosystem-based approach, they must consider the appropriate management objectives for the North Sea ecosystem as a whole. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Human population size and growth rate are often considered important drivers of biodiversity loss1–6 , whereas household dynamics are usually neglected. Aggregate demographic statistics may mask substantial changes in the size and number of house- holds, and their effects on biodiversity. Household dynamics influence per capita consumption7,8 and thus biodiversity through, for example, consumption of wood for fuel9 , habitat alteration for home building and associated activities10–12 , and greenhouse gas emissions13 . Here we report that growth in household numbers globally, and particularly in countries with biodiversity hotspots (areas rich in endemic species and threat- ened by human activities14 ), was more rapid than aggregate population growth between 1985 and 2000. Even when popu- lation size declined, the number of households increased sub- stantially. Had the average household size (that is, the number of occupants) remained static, there would have been 155 million fewer households in hotspot countries in 2000. Reduction in average household size alone will add a projected 233 million additional households to hotspot countries during the period 2000–15. Rapid increase in household numbers, often manifested as urban sprawl, and resultant higher per capita resource con- sumption in smaller households15–19 pose serious challenges to biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {Hubbard Glacier is expected to dam Russell Fiord and cause glacial flooding of the lower 20 km of the Situk River near Yakutat, Alaska. To determine probable effects of the flooding on juvenile salmonids Oncorhynchus spp., two rotary-screw traps were used to estimate smolt yield inside and outside the predicted flood zone. Traps were fished from April to mid-August 1990: one at the predicted upstream limit of flooding and the other 3 km upstream from the river mouth. Every week, a sample of each salmonid species was tattoo-marked and released 1 km above each trap; recaptures were used to expand catches to estimate smolt yield. Trap efficiency ranged widely among species, from 3% for steelhead O. mykiss to 24% for chinook salmon O. tshawytscha. Estimated total smolt yields were 900,000 sockeye salmon O. nerka, 213,000 coho salmon O. kisutch, 67,000 chinook salmon, and 26,000 steelhead; only sockeye salmon (34% of this species' smolts) originated in the flood zone. Estimated mortality between traps was 8% for coho salmon, 13% for chinook salmon, and 16% for sockeye salmon. Our study demonstrated that upriver and downriver rotary-screw traps and mark-recapture techniques can partition smolt yield, but mortality between traps and mark recognition must be considered.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The AuthorsIndigenous people harvest wild species for food and cultural practice, fundamentally linking biodiversity conservation and indigenous rights. Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are culturally significant to indigenous people (or First Nations) of coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada, who regulate their harvest under traditional governance structures. First Nations elders, however, have observed a decline in the body sizes and abundance of rockfishes, which coincides with increased exploitation by non-indigenous fishers. Rockfishes are vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity and offspring quality increase with maternal size or age, yet fisheries truncate size and age structure. During 2006, 2007 and 2013–2015, we worked with the Wuikinuxv, Nuxalk, Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai'Xais First Nations of BC's Central Coast, examining rockfish population characteristics at 282 of their fishing sites. We used hook-and-line gear to collect fishery independent data, and sampled landings from First Nations subsistence fishers. Spatial fishery closures served as experimental treatments. We also applied central place foraging theory to predict declines in size, age and abundance with increasing distance from recreational fishing lodges and other ports. Analyses used linear mixed models and controlled for environmental variables. Our results suggest that spatial closures for commercial and recreational fishers led to greater size and abundance of some, but not all rockfishes, possibly due to interspecific differences in the extent to which closures contain suitable habitat, effects of non-compliance, or other factors. Notably, Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), a species key to indigenous diets, were 21% larger inside than outside spatial closures. Possibly reflecting cumulative fishery exploitation, however, old-aged Yelloweye Rockfish were rare. Fishery impacts on size and relative abundance decreased at sites that required longer travel times and greater fuel costs for recreational fishers to exploit, but only for the longest-lived species (size responses) and for long-lived species analysed in aggregate (abundance responses). Measures for protecting indigenous access to rockfishes include evaluation of habitat suitability and compliance within spatial closures, improved understanding of recreational fishery impacts, and treating old-age and large size structures as explicit management objectives.

abstract = {An energetics model is implemented for lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, and applied to the Lake Michigan population. It includes an egestion function allowing any proportional mix of fish and invertebrates in the diet, a growth model accounting for both ontogenetic and seasonal changes in energy-density of predator and prey, a model for typical in situ swimming speed, and reproductive energy losses due to gametes shed. Gross conversion efficiency of energy by lake trout over their life (21.8%) is about twice the efficiency of converting biomass to growth because they store large amounts of high-energy fats. Highest conversion efficiencies are obtained by relatively fast-growing individuals, and over half the annual energy assimilated by older age-classes may be shed as gametes. Sensitivity analysis indicates a general robustness of the model, especially for estimating consumption by fitting a known growth curve. Largest sensitivities were for the intercept and weight dependence coefficients of metabolism. Population biomass and associated predatory impact of a given cohort increase steadily for about 3.5 yr then decline steadily after fishing mortality becomes important in the fourth year in the lake. This slow response time precludes manipulation of lake trout stocking densities as a means to control short-term prey fluctuations. Predation by lake trout on alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, has been increasing steadily since 1965 to about 8 400 t∙yr−1, and is projected to rise to almost 12 000 t∙yr−1 by 1990.},

Here we demonstrate how the effects of habitat quality (extra environmental factors) and detailed landscape structure (described with GIS [Geographical Information System]) can be included in a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. Expanded models are tested with a large data set on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). The incidence function model supplemented with additional environmental factors revealed some new and confirmed some previously known interactions between M. cinxia and its environment. However, the ability of the additional environmental factors to explain the error in the fit of the basic model was generally low (less than or equal to 15%). In the second variant of the basic model, landscape structure was used to modify effective patch isolations. This approach, though biologically appealing, failed to improve significantly the fit of the incidence function model. There are several possible reasons for this failure, including inaccurate satellite data, problems with habitat classification, and most importantly, generic problems in the modeling of migration. Our results demonstrate that additional complexity beyond the effects of habitat patch area and isolation does not necessarily improve the predictive power of a metapopulation model.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationships among life history traits, density dependence, and population dynamics is a central goal in ecology. It is also vital if we are to predict how populations respond to and recover from exploitation. We used data for 54 stocks of commercially exploited fish species to examine relationships between maximum annual recruitment at low stock size and the density dependence of recruitment at high stock size. We then related these recruitment measures to life history. At low stock sizes, stocks with high maximum recruitment (maximum spawners per spawner) showed the weakest density dependence of recruitment at high stock sizes. Spawning biomass per recruit in the absence of fishing (SPRF=0) showed a strong positive correlation with both maximum spawners per spawner and the strength of density dependence. Stocks with high SPRF=0 were typically large-bodied, slow-growing, late-maturing, and highly fecund with long generation times. These stocks produced low numbers of recruits each year, but survived to breed repeatedly and had strong density dependence of recruitment. In contrast, small-bodied, early-maturing fish had high annual recruitment and weak density dependence. These results place species on a continuum from “highly reproductive” to “survivors”. But we also demonstrate that density dependence is an important feature of the population biology of survivors.},

abstract = {One of the most fundamental components of predator-prey models is encounter rate, modelled as the product of prey density and search efficiency. Encounter rates have, however, rarely been measured in empirical studies. In this study, we used a video system approach to estimate how encounter rates between piscivorous fish that use a sit-and-wait foraging strategy and their prey depend on prey density and environmental factors such as turbidity. We first manipulated prey density in a controlled pool and field enclosure experiments where environmental factors were held constant. In a correlative study of 15 freshwater lakes we then estimated encounter rates in natural habitats and related the results to both prey fish density and environmental factors. We found the expected positive dependence of individual encounter rates on prey density in our pool and enclosure experiments, whereas the relation between school encounter rate and prey density was less clear. In the field survey, encounter rates did not correlate with prey density but instead correlated positively with water transparency. Water transparency decreases with increasing prey density along the productivity gradient and will reduce prey detection distance and thus predator search efficiency. Therefore, visual predator-prey encounter rates do not increase, and may even decrease, with increasing productivity despite increasing prey densities.},

abstract = {Broad geographic patterns in egg and clutch mass are poorly described, and potential causes of variation remain largely unexamined. We describe interspecific variation in avian egg and clutch mass within and among diverse geographic regions and explore hypotheses related to allometry, clutch size, nest predation, adult mortality, and parental care as correlates and possible explanations of variation. We studied 74 species of Passeriformes at four latitudes on three continents: the north temperate United States, tropical Venezuela, subtropical Argentina, and south temperate South Africa. Egg and clutch mass increased with adult body mass in all locations, but differed among locations for the same body mass, demonstrating that egg and clutch mass have evolved to some extent independent of body mass among regions. A major portion of egg mass variation was explained by an inverse relationship with clutch size within and among regions, as predicted by life-history theory. However, clutch size did not explain all geographic differences in egg mass; eggs were smallest in South Africa despite small clutch sizes. These small eggs might be explained by high nest predation rates in South Africa; life-history theory predicts reduced reproductive effort under high risk of offspring mortality. This prediction was supported for clutch mass, which was inversely related to nest predation but not for egg mass. Nevertheless, clutch mass variation was not fully explained by nest predation, possibly reflecting interacting effects of adult mortality. Tests of the possible effects of nest predation on egg mass were compromised by limited power and by counterposing direct and indirect effects. Finally, components of parental investment, defined as effort per offspring, might be expected to positively coevolve. Indeed, egg mass, but not clutch mass, was greater in species that shared incubation by males and females compared with species in which only females incubate eggs. However, egg and clutch mass were not related to effort of parental care as measured by incubation attentiveness. Ecological and life-history correlates of egg and clutch mass variation found here follow from theory, but possible evolutionary causes deserve further study.},

abstract = {<p>The Forest Resources Assessment 2015 is a comprehensive dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which provides the opportunity to explore some of the emerging topics related to sustainable forest management. This paper assesses how forests in British Columbia, Canada, compare globally on several key sustainable forest management parameters in four domains—biophysical indicators and legal framework, management plans, data management, and stakeholder involvement. The comparison was done against eight jurisdictions, namely Australia, China, Japan, the European Union, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and the USA. To accomplish our objectives, country-specific data on sustainable forest management parameters were extracted from the 2015 FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). Data specific to B.C. were sourced from Canada's National Forest Inventory, and National Forest Database. Our results showed that British Columbia (B.C.) has one of the highest proportions of land covered with forests (57%) among all jurisdictions. The total forest area in B.C. has remained stable at around 55 million ha. The current rate of deforestation (6200 ha per year) is among the lowest in all jurisdictions. Data on the extent of primary forests in B.C. is unavailable. However, 22.6 million ha (41% of B.C.′s forests) have been classified as old growth forests (using a definition unique to B.C.). B.C. is the leading provincial forest producer by volume, and produced 67.97 million m3 of roundwood in 2015. With approximately 11 billion m3 of standing timber, roundwood production volume has held steady since 1990. In British Columbia, the National Forest Inventory—British Columbia Program (NFI-B.C.) is used to track and monitor the current status of the forests. It involves both ground plots and remote sensing. The most recent B.C. State of the Forests is one of the most comprehensive reports among all jurisdictions, using 24 topic areas, with each topic comprising several indicators of sustainable forest management. We conclude that British Columbia ranks high among other jurisdictions on several key sustainable forest management parameters with legislation and forest management regimes aiming to meet the environmental, social and economic needs of current and future generations.</p>},

abstract = {Biodiversity targets, or estimates of the quantities of biodiversity features that should be conserved in a region, are fundamental to systematic conservation planning. We propose that targets for species should be based on the quantitative thresholds developed for the Vulnerable category of the IUCN Red List system, thereby avoiding future listings of species in an IUCN Red List threat category or an increase in the extinction risk, or ultimate extinction, of species already listed as threatened. Examples of this approach are presented for case studies from South Africa, including threatened taxa listed under the IUCN Red List criteria of A to D, a species listed as Near Threatened, a species of conservation concern due to its rarity, and one species in need of recovery. The method gives rise to multiple representation targets, an improvement on the often used single representation targets that are inadequate for long term maintenance of biodiversity or the arbitrary multiple representation and percentage targets that are sometimes adopted. Through the implementation of the resulting conservation plan, these targets will ensure that the conservation status of threatened species do not worsen over time by qualifying for higher categories of threat and may actually improve their conservation status by eliminating the threat of habitat loss and stabilizing population declines. The positive attributes ascribed to the IUCN Red List system, and therefore to the species targets arising from this approach, are important when justifying decisions that limit land uses known to be detrimental to biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The efficiency of visual predators may often be affected by complexity of habitat. For example, an increase in complexity of habitat may lead to an increase in search and/or pursuit times, while decreasing habitat complexity may reduce search and/or pursuit times and result in elevated feeding success. If true, it might be expected that predator rates of growth would be greater in small complexity habitats and decline with increasing complexity of habitat. In shallow turtlegrass (Thalassia testudinum) meadows, we used field enclosures to evaluate the effect of increasing turtlegrass density (small = 0-133 shoots/m2, intermediate = 177-267 shoots/m2, and large = > 267 shoots/m2) on the growth rates of juvenile pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides (Linneaus). Experiments were carried out five times during the growing season, with individual experiments lasting from 21 to 28 days. Benthic core samples were taken to examine differences among treatments and possible caging effects on plant surface area, faunal abundance and epiphyte coverage. We found a consistent pattern of decreasing growth with increasing density of vegetation, although due to low power, ANOVA showed no significant differences among treatments. However, the probability of obtaining the same treatment rankings we observed by chance was very low (P = 0.003). The effects of vegetation density on annual growth rates were also examined, and we estimated a 20% decrease in growth rates between small and large vegetation density treatments. These results suggest that vegetation density can have an impact on growth rates that is biologically significant.},

abstract = {We evaluated fish species composition relative to dissolved oxygen concentrations in Mercer Bayou, a vegetated impoundment in southwest Arkansas. Sampling stations were distributed among three reaches that varied in dissolved oxygen concentrations ranging from 0.2 to7.5 mg/l. Hypoxia was pronounced at the downstream reach of the bayou because of stagnant water and nearly complete shading of the water's surface by floating plants. Fishes were sampled in each reach by seining and gill netting. Forty-five fish species were collected and the assemblage was dominated by phytophilic taxa. In upper and middle reaches, species richness was relatively high (>13 species per sample). In the lower hypoxic reach, species richness was low (<8 species per sample). Polynomial regression indicated a significant positive relation (R2 = 0.67) between species richness (y) and dissolved oxygen (x): y = 8.03 + 7.19x - 0.72x2. Species richness, abundance, and size of fish were substantially reduced at dissolved oxygen concentrations below 0.5 mg/l, suggesting a threshold response level of assemblage composition. Gars, topminnows, and small backwater sunfishes (29% of all species documented) persisted at low dissolved oxygen concentrations, but other sunfishes, darters, and larger benthic fishes avoided hypoxic waters, probably due to physiological limitations. Species adapted for aerial and surface film respiration dominated the fish assemblage in hypoxic waters. Our model suggests that dissolved oxygen can be used to predict fish species composition and quantify habitat quality in vegetated areas.},

abstract = {We compared and integrated marine protected areas proposed through community and scientific assessments in 2 regions of British Columbia, Canada. The community priorities were identified during individual and group interviews with knowledgeable resource users. The scientific priorities were developed with abiotic and biotic data in Marxan, a decision-support tool. The resulting maps of community-based and science-based priorities were very similar for the inshore areas, which lent credibility to both approaches. The resource users thought the science-based maps were fairly good at highlighting areas important for conservation, but preferred the scenarios that integrated the 2 maps to either constituent map. Incorporating spatial variation in human impacts on the marine areas and commercial fishing, which are both costs of protection, into our Marxan analyses led to scenarios that were different from either constituent map. Our results show the value of integrating community-based and science-based approaches in conservation planning to achieve community acceptance and conservation utility. They also reveal that people's assessments on the basis of their traditional ecological knowledge may serve as a reasonable proxy for scientific approaches in selecting areas of ecological value. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Current debates about the efficacy of no-take marine reserves (MR) in protecting large pelagic fish such as tuna and sharks have usually not considered the evolutionary dimension of this issue, which emerges because the propensity to swim away from a given place, like any other biological trait, will probably vary in a heritable fashion among individuals. Here, based on spatially explicit simulations, we investigated whether selection to remain in MRs to avoid higher fishing mortality can lead to the evolution of more philopatric fish. Our simulations, which covered a range of life histories among tuna species (skipjack tuna vs. Atlantic bluefin tuna) and shark species (great white sharks vs. spiny dogfish), suggested that MRs were most effective at maintaining viable population sizes when movement distances were lowest. Decreased movement rate evolved following the establishment of marine reserves, and this evolution occurred more rapidly with higher fishing pressure. Evolutionary reductions in movement rate led to increases in within-reserve population sizes over the course of the 50 years following MR establishment, although this varied among life histories, with skipjack responding fastest and great white sharks slowest. Our results suggest the evolution of decreased movement can augment the efficacy of marine reserves, especially for species, such as skipjack tuna, with relatively short generation times. Even when movement rates did not evolve substantially over 50 years (e.g., given long generation times or little heritable variation), marine reserves were an effective tool for the conservation of fish populations when mean movement rates were low or MRs were large.},

An annual State of the Pacific Ocean meeting is held to review the physical, biological and selected fishery resources and present the results of the most recent year's monitoring in the context of previous observations and expected future conditions. The workshop to review conditions during 2014 took place at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, Sidney, B.C. on March 10 and 11, 2015, with over 100 participants both in person and via webinar. In general, Pacific Canadian waters experience strong seasonality and considerable freshwater influence and include relatively protected regions such as the Strait of Georgia as well as areas fully exposed to the open ocean conditions of the Pacific. The region supports ecologically and economically important resident and migratory populations of invertebrates, groundfish, pelagic fishes, marine mammals and seabirds. Observations of the marine environment in early 2014 identified a large pool of very warm water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and an area of cooler water along the west coast of North America. By the end of the year the very warm water had moved into the coastal regions with record high temperatures recorded at many locations in the fall. Monitoring of the biological conditions showed the influences of this warm water on marine species composition and distribution. Such observations include a change from cold water to warm water zooplankton taxa from spring to fall 2014 off the west coast of Vancouver island, the second year with no sardines observed in B.C. waters, a record proportion of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon returning via the ‘northern diversion' through Johnstone Strait, and mass mortalities of juvenile Cassin's Auklets (a plankton-feeding seabird) in late fall 2014. Warmer than normal weather was experienced in the fall and winter of 2014 along the west coast of British Columbia with less regional snowpack evident in the spring of 2015. A special session at the meeting was convened to examine the emerging issue of ocean acidification. The level of monitoring and research on this subject was considered below that required given the potential risk to the health of the environment and commercial interests. The proposals of groups to advance the work on this subject were discussed.},

abstract = {Highly valued, hunted, managed, and traded by indigenous people for at least 12,000 years, sea otters share a deep history of interactions with humans along North America's northwest coast. Yet the nineteenth century extirpation and subsequent recovery of sea otters triggered profound ecological, cultural, and socio-economic transformations that continue to elicit complex trade-offs that coastal communities grapple with today. To expand our understanding of past baselines, future recovery targets, and the role First Nations in British Columbia and Alaska once played in altering and managing coastal resources, including sea otters, we synthesized evidence from archeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional knowledge, and contemporary ecological research. Archeological evidence suggests that sea otter hunting was a significant and widespread practice among aboriginal people in this area throughout the Holocene, although the magnitude of use varied spatially. Furthermore, isotopic evidence suggests that over the millennia, sea otters may have been reduced in numbers, existing below carrying capacity, and excluded near human settlements. Furthermore, traditional knowledge and historical records reveal that indigenous peoples of the northwest coast developed diverse technologies to conserve and manage coastal marine resources, such as selective harvesting, seasonal restrictions on use or consumption, and proprietorship that was contingent on sustained productivity. Ancient marine tenure systems and governance protocols based on reciprocity were used to conserve and spatially manage most marine species, including sea otters. Current First Nations perspectives on sea otter conservation and management vary among people and through time as sea otter population status changes, as communities adapt to this perturbation, and as new legal frameworks supporting First Nations rights to co-management emerge.},

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon stocks have also experienced recent declines in productivity by investigating temporal and spatial trends in productivity of 99 wild North American pink and chum salmon stocks. We used a combination of population dynamics and time series models to quantify individual stock trends as well as common temporal trends in pink and chum salmon productivity across local, regional, and continental spatial scales. Our results indicated widespread declines in productivity of wild chum salmon stocks throughout Washington (WA) and British Columbia (BC) with 81% of stocks showing recent declines in productivity, although the exact form of the trends varied among regions. For pink salmon, the majority of stocks in WA and BC (65%) did not have strong temporal trends in productivity; however, all stocks that did have trends in productivity showed declining productivity since at least brood year 1996. We found weaker evidence of widespread declines in productivity for Alaska pink and chum salmon, with some regions and stocks showing declines in productivity (e.g., Kodiak chum salmon stocks) and others showing increases (e.g., Alaska Peninsula pink salmon stocks). We also found strong positive covariation between stock productivity series at the regional spatial scale for both pink and chum salmon, along with evidence that this regional-scale positive covariation has become stronger since the early 1990s in WA and BC. In general, our results suggest that common processes operating at the regional or multi-regional spatial scales drive productivity of pink and chum salmon stocks in western North America and that the effects of these process on productivity may change over time.},

abstract = {Climate change is projected to increase stress for many coastal plant communities. Along large portions of the North American coast, habitat degradation from anthropogenic changes to the environment already threaten the community structure of tidal marshes and submerged aquatic grass beds. The potential loss of ecological services historically provided by these communities has been a long-standing rationale for aggressive control of invading plants such as Phragmites australis and Hydrilla verticillata. Increasing evidence of ecological services provided by invasive species such as P. australis and H. verticillata suggest that, in the face of increasing stress, it may be prudent to take a more pragmatic approach regarding the effect of these species on coastal ecosystems. The notable resilience of these species to control efforts and their competitive success and comparative vigor in stressed systems and capacity to provide at least some beneficial services combine to suggest some invasive species may have a useful role in managed coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {—Experimental modeling of angler choice behavior is slowly emerging as an alternative to both the modeling of actual fishing behavior (revealed preferences), and the modeling of be-havioral antecedents, such as attitudes, beliefs, and opinions. These conjoint-based choice modeling approaches are particularly useful for evaluating various fisheries management alternatives and programs. In this study we applied a discrete choice experiment (DCE), which relies on the principle of fractional factorial designs, to produce hypothetical profiles of fishing opportunities. The study was conducted in Engerdal, eastern Norway. Engerdal is a popular fishing area for locals and tourists from Norway and Sweden. Proper harvest regulation of a popular sport fishery for brown trout Salmo trutta and European grayling Thymallus thymallus is the major challenge to fisheries management in the area. Data were collected in a mail survey in the fall of 1996. Three regulation variables (minimum size limit, bag limit, and bait type) and two expectation variables (expected average fish size and expected catch numbers) were considered in this DCE. The study uncovered major differences in preferences for fishing opportunities between fly-only anglers and other angler groups. The fundamental difference between the main angling groups suggests that spatial seg-regation of these segments should be an essential management strategy, if both groups are to be provided with satisfactory experiences. The study shows great promise for using conjoint-based choice modeling in understanding angler responses to different harvest regulation alternatives. Future research is needed to refine its application in the human dimensions research.},

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are intense thermal anomalies where water temperature is significantly elevated for five or more days. Climate projections suggest an increase in the frequency and severity of MHWs in the coming decades. While there is evidence that marine protected areas (MPAs) may be able to buffer individual species from climate impacts, there is not sufficient evidence to support the idea that MPAs can mitigate large-scale changes in marine communities in response to MHWs. California experienced an intense MHW and subsequent El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation event from 2014 to 2016. We sought to examine changes in rocky reef fish communities at four MPAs and associated reference sites in relation to the MHW. We observed a decline in taxonomic diversity and a profound shift in trophic diversity inside and outside MPAs following the MHW. However, MPAs seemed to dampen the loss of trophic diversity and in the four years following the MHW, taxonomic diversity recovered 75% faster in the MPAs compared to reference sites. Our results suggest that MPAs may contribute to long-term resilience of nearshore fish communities through both resistance to change and recovery from warming events.},

abstract = {—Use of point-count surveys is a popular method for collecting data on abun-dance and distribution of birds. However, analyses of such data often ignore potential dif-ferences in detection probability. We adapted a removal model to directly estimate detection probability during point-count surveys. The model assumes that singing frequency is a ma-jor factor influencing probability of detection when birds are surveyed using point counts. This may be appropriate for surveys in which most detections are by sound. The model re-quires counts to be divided into several time intervals. Point counts are often conducted for 10 min, where the number of birds recorded is divided into those first observed in the first 3 min, the subsequent 2 min, and the last 5 min. We developed a maximum-likelihood es-timator for the detectability of birds recorded during counts divided into those intervals. This technique can easily be adapted to point counts divided into intervals of any length. We applied this method to unlimited-radius counts conducted in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We used model selection criteria to identify whether detection probabilities varied among species, throughout the morning, throughout the season, and among different observers. We found differences in detection probability among species. Species that sing frequently such as Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) had high detection probabilities (ϳ90%) and species that call infrequently such as Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) had low detection probability (36%). We also found detection probabilities varied with the time of day for some species (e.g. thrushes) and be-tween observers for other species. We used the same approach to estimate detection prob-ability and density for a subset of the observations with limited-radius point counts. Received 23 February 2000, accepted 9 October 2001.

@article{Alexanderson2006,
abstract = {Graph theory almost certainly began when, in 1735, Leonhard Euler solved a popular puzzle about bridges. The East Prussian city of K{\"{o}}nigsberg (now Kalin-ingrad) occupies both banks of the River Pregel and an island, Kneiphof, which lies in the river at a point where it branches into two parts. There were seven bridges that spanned the various sections of the river, and the problem posed was this: could a person devise a path through K{\"{o}}nigsberg so that one could cross each of the seven bridges only once and return home? Long thought to be impossible, the first mathematical demonstration of this was presented by Euler to the members of the Petersburg Academy on August 26, 1735, and written up the following year under the title " Solutio Problematis ad Geometriam Situs Pertinentis (The solution to a problem relating to the geometry of position) " [2] in the proceedings of the Petersburg Academy (the Commentarii). The title page of this volume appears on the cover of this issue of the Bulletin. This story is well-known, and the illustrations in Euler's paper are often repro-duced in popular books on mathematics and in textbooks. Sandifer in [6] claims flatly that " The K{\"{o}}nigsberg Bridge Problem is Euler's most famous work, " though scholars in other specialties (differential equations, complex analysis, calculus of variations, combinatorics, number theory, physics, naval architecture, music, . . .) might disagree. N. L. Biggs, E. K. Lloyd, and R. J. Wilson in their history of graph theory [1] clearly view this paper of Euler's as seminal and remark: " The origins of graph theory are humble, even frivolous. Whereas many branches of mathematics were motivated by fundamental problems of calculation, motion, and measurement, the problems which led to the development of graph theory were often little more than puzzles, designed to test the ingenuity rather than to stimulate the imagina-tion. But despite the apparent triviality of such puzzles, they captured the interest of mathematicians, with the result that graph theory has become a subject rich in theoretical results of a surprising variety and depth. " Euler provides only a neces-sary condition, not a sufficient condition, for solving the problem. But he does treat more than the original problem by beginning a generalization to two islands and four rivers, as is illustrated in the plate accompanying the original paper (Figure 1). In this renowned paper Euler does not get around to stating the problem until the second page. On the first he states the reason for being interested in the problem— it was an example of a class of problems he attributes to Leibniz as belonging to something Leibniz called " geometry of position. " Euler says that " this branch is concerned only with the determination of position and its properties; it does not c 2006 American Mathematical Society Reverts to public domain 28 years from publication 567 568 GERALD L. ALEXANDERSON involve distances, nor calculations made with them. " So, he goes on to say, when " a problem was recently mentioned, which seemed geometrical but was so constructed that it did not require the measurement of distances, nor did calculation help at all, I had no doubt that it was concerned with the geometry of position. " This was an about-face for Euler, since earlier he had complained in a letter to Carl Leonhard Ehler, mayor of Danzig, that the K{\"{o}}nigsberg problem " bears little relationship to mathematics . . . for the solution is based on reason alone, and its discovery does not depend on any mathematical principle. " He claimed that he was " ignorant as to what this new discipline [geometry of position] involves, and as to which types of problem Leibniz and [Christian] Wolff expected to see expressed in this way " [5]. To the modern reader, though, the " geometry of position " sounds a lot like topology, but more on that later. The title of the Biggs, Lloyd and Wilson volume is Graph Theory/1736-1936, and it is interesting that the authors refer to 1736 rather than the date of Euler's first report. Possibly the later date was chosen because by using 1736 they were able to add to their account the publication in 1936 of the first full-length book on graph theory by D{\'{e}}nes K{\"{o}}nig. They could as well have chosen the starting date as 1741, however, since the publication of Euler's paper did not occur till then. Backlogs were apparently a problem even in the 18th century, but perhaps they were more of a problem for Euler than most since he was so prolific. His work practically dominated the proceedings of the Petersburg Academy even after he moved to Berlin in 1740 and subsequently when he returned to St. Petersburg in 1766. In the 1741 volume of the Commentarii the articles were split up into three " classes " (Mathematics, Physics, and History) with another category of " observations " on astronomy and meteorology. Within the Mathematics section, eleven of the thirteen articles were by Euler. The other two were by Daniel Bernoulli. It is interesting to note the company this first article on graph theory keeps in this volume, which includes the articles that Euler wrote in 1735 and 1736. Five of his papers are on series or properties of curves. One is on number theory, one on calculus of variations, one on elliptic integrals, and two on astronomy or physics. And then there's this rather amazing paper on graph theory. Not surprisingly, both of Bernoulli's papers are on hydrodynamics. Here's Euler's list: • Methodus universalis serierum convergentium summas quam proxime inve-niendi (A universal method for finding sums of convergent series approximately) • Inventio summae cuiusque seriei ex dato termino generali (Finding the sum of a series from a given general term) • Investigatio binarum curvarum, quarum arcus eidem abscissae respondentes summam algebraicam constituant (An investigation of pairs of curves whose arcs that correspond to the same abscissa constitute an algebraic sum) • De Oscillationibus fili flexilis quotcunque pondusculis onusti (On the oscillation of a flexible wire weighted with arbitrarily many small weights) • Methodus computandi aequationem meridiei (A method for computing the equation of a meridian) • De constructione aequationum ope motus tractorii, aliisque ad methodum tan-gentium inversam pertinentibus (On the construction of equations using a dragging motion and on other things pertinent to the inverse method of tangents)},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2015. Size-at-age information is critical in estimating growth parameters (e.g., the von Bertalanffy growth function [VBGF]) that are used to assess fish populations. Due to gear selectivity, single sampling methods rarely sample all ages or all sizes equally well. Most growth estimates rely on samples from a single gear or a haphazard combination of gears, potentially leading to biased and imprecise growth parameter estimates. We evaluated the efficacy of combining samples from two gears with different size selectivity to estimate VBGF parameters; we then applied that approach to a case study on the Lochloosa Lake (Florida) population of Black Crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus. Simulated age- and size-structured populations were randomly sampled with two gears characterized by different size-selectivity curves (one gear was selective for smaller fish; the other was selective for larger fish). Maximum likelihood VBGF estimates obtained for each gear separately were compared with estimates from a combined VBGF fitted to data from both gears. In every simulated scenario, a combined-gear approach reduced bias and increased precision for estimating the VBGF, but the gear-specific proportions that improved VBGF estimates depended on size selectivity. The VBGF estimates for the Black Crappie population showed that the combined-gear method yielded intermediate parameter values relative to single-gear approaches based on (1) trawl sampling (fishery-independent survey) and (2) angler harvest (as determined from carcass collections; fishery-dependent data). Furthermore, the combined-gear approach had greater precision in individual parameter estimates and much less variance than single-gear approaches when estimating the VBGF. Combining data from two gears can increase sample representativeness, leading to improvements in VBGF estimation. Such approaches can reduce uncertainty in VBGF estimation and can provide insight into key demographic processes occurring in fish populations for which ontogeny and gear selectivity lead to imperfect sampling.

An attempt was made to break down some of the barriers to more interdisciplinary research on recreational fisheries at the 6th World Recreational Fishing Conference. The overall conclusion was that future research and management efforts should increasingly focus on the feedbacks between the interacting human and ecological components of recreational fisheries. Doing so promises to improve understanding of how recreational fisheries respond to social–ecological change. In this context, the behaviour of both fishes and humans provides an important, yet often overlooked, integrator of the ecological and social components of recreational fisheries. A better understanding of the behavioural dynamics of recreational fishers as well as exploited fishes will help predict how recreational fisheries change, evolve, adapt and reorganise through time to maintain resilience and achieve sustainability on a global scale.},

Because their operations are shrouded by the myth that forage fish are unsuitable for human consumption, the role of these fisheries in intensive food production is not well understood or appreciated. Thus, although they account for over 30% of global landings of marine fish annually, our knowledge of how these levels of removal impact on marine ecosystems is limited. Nevertheless, there is considerable scope for policy makers to change the current management of these fisheries and to enhance their contribution to food security and economic development.

abstract = {Landscape ecology deals with the effects of the spatial configuration of mosaics on a wide variety of ecological phenomena. Because problems in many areas of conservation biology and resource management are related to landscape use, development of a rigorous theoretical and empirical foundation for landscape ecology is essential. We present an approach to research that focuses on how individual-level mechanisms operating in a heterogeneous mosaic produce ecological patterns that are spatially dependent. The theoretical framework that we develop considers the density and distribution of a population among patches as a function of (a) within-patch movement patterns of individuals; (b) emigration from patches as a function of population density, patch configuration, patch context, and within-patch movement; and (c) loss of individuals as they disperse through landscape elements. This theoretical framework is coupled with an empirical approach that emphasizes the use of experimental model systems (EMS), small-scale systems occupying "microlandscapes." Such systems are amenable to experimental manipulation with adequate replication and control and may serve as analogs of systems occurring at broader landscape scales, where rigorous empirical work is more difficult. We illustrate the use of EMS with examples from our studies of beetles and ants in North America and of voles in Norway. Finally, we consider some factors that may constrain extrapolations from EMS to other systems, scales, or levels.

abstract = {After decades of historic exploitation, harbor seal Phoca vitulina populations in many marine ecosystems are increasing, and in some cases causing alarm over predation impacts on prey species of conservation concern. To gauge the magnitude of harbor seal predation impact on juvenile Puget Sound steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss, a threatened population under the US Endangered Species Act, we quantified harbor seal predation rates in the Nisqually River estuary and nearshore marine environment of south Puget Sound in Washington State, USA, using 2 independent assessments. First, we developed a prey consumption model for the years 2016–2018 using the proportion of steelhead in seal scat (assessed using DNA metabarcoding, bioinformatics, and hard parts), seal daily energetic requirements, steelhead smolt size and abundance information, and seal abundance estimates. Second, we used acoustic telemetry data from individually tagged steelhead smolts (2014–2019 and 2021) to quantify predation events in the Nisqually River estuary based on spatial and temporal behavioral patterns of both predator and prey. The consumption model estimated that 9.0% (2017) to 32.8% (2018) of steelhead outmigrants (i.e. ‘smolts') were eaten by harbor seals, accounting for most of the total mortality incurred in the Nisqually estuary and South Puget Sound (23 km) in 2 out of 3 years. Predation mortality rates through the estuary (5 km), assessed using acoustic telemetry analysis, ranged from 11.0% (2014) to 24.8% (2016). Our results demonstrate that a large proportion of a threatened salmonid population can be lost to harbor seal predation over a small segment of their migration route, even in a relatively natural delta estuary.},

abstract = {Oil and gas interests and the government recently offered a First Nation in the Skeena River estuary (BC, Canada) $1 billion to consent to construction of a controversial terminal to load fossil fuels onto tankers ([ 1 ][1]). The proposal highlights a troubling blind spot in Canada's environmental decisionmaking. This gap could enable decisions that insufficiently consider risks to both environment and people. Science can help decrease these blind spots. The second-largest salmon producer in Canada, the Skeena River has supported First Nation fisheries for 5 millennia ([ 2 ][2]). Its estuary is a nursery for hundreds of millions of young salmon annually as they graduate from freshwater to sea ([ 2 ][2]). It is also situated between fossil fuel reserves in interior Canada and ocean-access to Asian markets. Multinational companies have proposed pipelines to and terminals in the estuary, and are currently assessing the environmental impacts on constitutionally protected ([ 3 ][3]) aboriginal fisheries. Previous research indicates that industrialized estuaries depress salmon survival ([ 4 ][4]). Although terminal proponents and the government have recognized interests of First Nations from the estuary during environmental assessment, they have ignored interests of upriver First Nations who also harvest salmon ([ 5 ][5]). Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers during their life. We have shown that the proposed development area supports particularly high abundances of juvenile salmon from more than 40 populations that are harvested in at least 10 First Nations territories throughout the Skeena watershed and beyond ([ 6 ][6], [ 7 ][7]). This is twice the number of First Nations groups that industry proponents identified as needing to be consulted ([ 5 ][5]). These data reveal a striking mismatch between the narrow consideration of aboriginal rights and environmental risks and the true scale of environmental connections, which needs to be addressed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and industrial proponents. The terminal application is being evaluated by CEAA without consideration of upriver First Nations ([ 5 ][5]). Moreover, despite the resounding rejection of the $1 billion by the estuary First Nation due to environmental and cultural concerns, the government has ratified fiscal agreements with terminal proponents ([ 8 ][8]).

How- ever, the observed changes may also represent a plastic response to environmental variability. To dis- entangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary change, the probabilistic reaction norm approach was applied to 43 cohorts (1960 to 2002) of female sole Solea solea from market samples. The reaction norm for age and size at first maturation has significantly shifted towards younger age and smaller size. Size at 50% probability of maturation at Age 3 decreased from 28.6 cm (251 g) to 24.6 cm (128 g). This change was even stronger when condition was included as a third dimension in the reaction norm estimation. The influence of alternative factors was tested on the population level by regression of reaction norm midpoints on annual estimates of condition, temperature and competitive biomass. Although effects of temperature and competitive biomass were significant, the variation in the midpoints was best explained by the decreasing time trend. Therefore, the results provide strong evidence for a fisheries-induced evolutionary change in the onset of sexual maturity.},

abstract = {Leslie matrices and life tables are demographic models commonly used to evaluate the ability of specific elasmobranch life history strategies to sustain given levels and patterns of fishing pressure. These models are generally density independent and provide an instantaneous rate of population growth for a specified set of life history traits that correspond to a specific population size. Many investigators are using these models to compute rates of population growth that they claim are estimates of the maximum population growth rate (rintrinsic); they then use these estimates to compute purported estimates of maximum sustainable fishing mortality. However, neither a Leslie matrix nor a life table can be used to estimate rintrinsic without additional information, except in the special case where a severely depleted population is modeled. Only in a severely depleted population will competition for resources be at a minimum and both density-dependent compensation and the rate of population growth be at a maximum (i.e., at rintrinsic). The fundamental problem is to determine the life history parameters that would occur if the population were extremely depleted because extensive observations on extremely depleted populations are rare. In the absence of such data, rintrinsic can only be estimated from these types of density-independent models by extrapolating observed population growth rates toward zero population size. We illustrate the problems in, and describe methods for, estimating rintrinsic and present information on two species of elasmobranch: barndoor skate Dipturus laevis and lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris.},

To quantify anglers' exaggeration, I compared the ratios of protected-length to legal-length walleyes as reported by anglers with similar ratios confirmed from test angling at 22 walleye sport fisheries from 1991 to 2000. Overall, anglers reported catching 2.2 times more protected-length walleyes per legal-length walleyes than were caught in the test-angling fisheries. Exaggeration in catches was not constant but increased exponentially with decreasing catch rate. On-site exaggeration, in combination with further exaggeration in mail surveys, results in the reported catch rate declining at a lower rate than the actual catch rate, thereby causing a perception of hyperstability in the fishery.

abstract = {Fish grow considerably in size during their ontogeny. In size-structured populations, effects of body size on ecological processes can result in abrupt shifts in diet, habitat use and growth patterns. Thus, at a functional level, many size-structured fish populations can be viewed as stage-structured. Stage-structured consumer populations can link the dynamics of different habitats (and associated fauna) and may therefore play a critical role in transmitting effects of resource gradients to other parts of the community or landscape. Using data for sunfishes inhabiting Michigan lakes, we demonstrate how the effects of body size and correlated traits create stage structure in two common sunfishes: the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque) and pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus [Linnaeus]). Pumpkinseed populations segregate into two distinct stages through the interaction between functional morphology and resource availability: small fish feed on soft-bodied littoral invertebrates, while larger fish feed primarily on snails. Bluegill, the most abundant fish in these lakes, also exhibit stage structure: small bluegill exploit the same littoral resource as small pumpkinseed, but large bluegill feed on limnetic zooplankton. This stage structure is driven by the interaction between habitat-specific foraging gain and predation risk. Evidence suggests that the production of limnetic resources (large zooplankton) coupled with bluegill stage structure drives patterns of bluegill growth and density. The density of juvenile bluegill increases along the limnetic productivity gradient, leading to intensified intra-stage competition. In their early life history stages, littoral fishes such as pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch (Perca flavescens [Mitchill]), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides [Lacepede]) also exploit littoral resources, and their growth rates also decline with increasing density of juvenile bluegill. These competitive effects can cascade through the fishes' life histories and affect the resources and performance of later life history stages. These results demonstrate how different habitats and faunal groups can be coupled via the stage-structured habitat use of a dominant consumer.},

Vessel locations were available from logbooks, vessel monitoring system (VMS) data from many of the largest vessels, and from observer records. There was high spatial coherence between VMS- and observer-derived trawling locations. Prior to establishment, 31% of trawl effort (1991–1993) occurred within the 22 000 km2 of area that would eventually be closed year-round. In 2001–2003 about 10% of effort targeting groundfish was deployed within 1 km of the marine protected area (MPA) boundaries, and about 25% within 5 km. Density gradients, consistent with spill-over from MPAs, were apparent for some species. Average revenue per hour trawled was about twice as high within 4 km of the boundary, than for more distant catches, but the catch variability was greater nearer closed area boundaries. Seasonal closed areas attracted more fishing effort after opening than prior to closure even while average cpue was the same or lower. Spatial resolution of traditional data sources (e.g., logbooks) was too crude to discern detailed MPA-related effects, as revealed by high-resolution vessel positions from VMS and catch data obtained by observers.},

abstract = {Conservation and management increasingly focus on connectivity, because connectivity driven by variation in immigration rates across landscapes is thought to be crucial for maintaining local population and metapopulation persistence. Yet, efforts to quantify the relative role of immigration on population growth across the entire range of species and over time have been lacking. We assessed whether immigration limited local and range-wide population growth of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA, over 18 years using multi-state, reverse-time modelling that accounts for imperfect detection of individuals and unobservable states. Demographic contributions of immigration varied depending on the dynamics and geographic position of the local populations, were scale-dependent and changed over time. By comparing the relative contributions of immigration versus local demography for periods of significant change in local abundance, we found empirical evidence for a disproportionately large role of immigration in facilitating population growth of a centrally located population—a connectivity ‘hub'. The importance of connectivity changed depending of the spatial scale considered, such that immigration was a more important driver of population growth at small versus large spatial scales. Furthermore, the contribution of immigration was much greater during time periods when local population size was small, emphasizing abundance-dependent rescue effects. Our findings suggest that efforts aimed at improving local breeding habitat will likely be most effective at increasing snail kite population growth. More broadly, our results provide much needed information on the role of connectivity for population growth, suggesting that connectivity conservation may have the greatest benefits when efforts focus on centrally located habitat patches and small populations. Furthermore, our results highlight that connectivity is highly dynamic over time and that interpreting the effects of connectivity at local scales may not transfer to region-wide dynamics.},

abstract = {Ecosystem restoration may require returning threatened populations of ecologically pivotal species to near their former abundances, but it is often difficult to estimate historic population size of species that have been heavily exploited. Eastern Pacific gray whales play a key ecological role in their Arctic feeding grounds and are widely thought to have returned to their prewhaling abundance. Recent mortality spikes might signal that the population has reached long-term carrying capacity, but an alternative is that this decline was due to shifting climatic conditions on Arctic feeding grounds. We used a genetic approach to estimate prewhaling abundance of gray whales and report DNA variability at 10 loci that is typical of a population of ≈76,000-118,000 individuals, approximately three to five times more numerous than today's average census size of 22,000. Coalescent simulations indicate these estimates may include the entire Pacific metapopulation, suggesting that our average measurement of ≈96,000 individuals was probably distributed between the eastern and currently endangered western Pacific populations. These levels of genetic variation suggest the eastern population is at most at 28-56% of its historical abundance and should be considered depleted. If used to inform management, this would halve acceptable human-caused mortality for this population from 417 to 208 per year. Potentially profound ecosystem impacts may have resulted from a decline from 96,000 gray whales to the current population. At previous levels, gray whales may have seasonally resuspended 700 million cubic meters of sediment, as much as 12 Yukon Rivers, and provided food to a million sea birds. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

EROD induction in fish is well characterized, the most important modifying factors being fish species, reproductive status and age, all of which can be controlled through proper study design. Good candidate species for biomonitoring should have a wide range between basal and induced EROD activity (e.g., common carp, channel catfish, and mummichog). EROD activity has proven value as a biomarker in a number of field investigations of bleached kraft mill and industrial effluents, contaminated sediments, and chemical spills. Research on mechanisms of CYP1A-induced toxicity suggests that EROD activity may not only indicate chemical exposure, but also may also precede effects at various levels of biological organization. A current research need is the development of chemical exposure-response relationships for EROD activity in fish. In addition, routine reporting in the literature of EROD activity in standard positive and negative control material will enhance confidence in comparing results from different studies using this biomarker.},

Large errors make recruitments appear to be independent of spawning stocks. This effect promotes overexploitation rather than simply making the relationship noisier and harder to measure. Efforts to explain variation in recruitment through factors other than spawning stock may be deceptive as well. Much fisheries theory and practice are based on the assumption that recruitment is largely independent of spawning stock; that assumption is not credible except in cases where spawning stocks are known to have been measured accurately.Key words: stock, recruitment, statistics, overexploitation},

Macroclimatic variation along latitudinal gradients provides an excellent natural laboratory to investigate the role of temperature and the potential impacts of climate warming on terrestrial organ- isms. 2. Here, we review the use of latitudinal gradients for ecological climate change research, in com- parison with altitudinal gradients and experimental warming, and illustrate their use and caveats with a meta-analysis of latitudinal intraspecific variation in important life-history traits of vascular plants. 3. We first provide an overview of latitudinal patterns in temperature and other abiotic and biotic environmental variables in terrestrial ecosystems. We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life-history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (R:S) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species. 4. Intraspecific leaf N:P ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural popula- tions. Conversely, the plant height decreased and SLA increased significantly with latitude of popula- tion origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental driv- ers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal. 5. Synthesis. Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set-up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life- history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and con- founding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, inte- grated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.},

This paper draws on three co-management cases from the Canadian Arctic to examine the role of knowledge co-production as an institutional trigger or mechanism to enable learning and adapting. Experience with knowledge co-production across the three cases is variable but outcomes illustrate how co-management actors are learning to learn through uncertainty and environmental change, or learning to be adaptive. Policy implications of this analysis are highlighted and include the importance of a long-term commitment to institution building, an enabling policy environment to sustain difficult social processes associated with knowledge co-production, and the value of diverse modes of communication, deliberation and social interaction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Water level stabilization for flood control can cause persistent occurrence of dense stands of emergent macrophytes, which can affect the physicochemical environment for fishes. We evaluated dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in five emergent macrophyte species (cattail Typha spp., pickerelweed Pontedaria cordata, smartweed Polygonum spp., torpedograss Panicum repens, and water primrose Ludwigia spp.) at three levels of macrophyte coverage (i.e., 5064, 6579, and 8095%) at Lake Istokpoga, Florida during JulyAugust (summer) and OctoberNovember (fall) 2007. Dissolved oxygen exhibited substantial spatial and temporal variability at small scales (i.e., meters and hours), with the lowest DO and highest probability of hypoxia occurring in smartweed and water primrose habitats relative to other macrophyte types. The probability of hypoxia increased with macrophyte coverage for all macrophyte species tested. Dissolved oxygen was influenced by the structural differences (e.g., stem density and size) and spatial orientation (e.g., proximity to open water) associated with the individual macrophyte habitats. Restoration efforts that create open water pathways and maximize edge areas might improve DO concentrations and habitat quality and quantity for freshwater fishes.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based management of natural resources involves an explicit consideration of trade-offs among ecosystem services. In marine fisheries, there is the potential for a trade-off between the supporting role of small pelagic fish and cephalopods in food webs, and the provisioning service they play as a major target of fisheries. Because these species play central roles in food webs by providing a conduit of energy from small prey to upper trophic level predators, we hypothesized that trade-offs between these two ecosystem services could be predicted based on energetic properties of predator-prey linkages and foodweb structure. We compiled information from 27 marine food-web models (all within the Ecopath framework) that included either small pelagic fish or cephalopods, described predator-prey linkages involving these species, and developed a novel analytical framework to estimate how changes in yields of forage species would propagate through food webs and other fisheries. Consistent with expectations, diet overlap between predators and prey was generally low, and predator-prey linkages tended to be asymmetric; contribution of these species to predator diets was, on average, larger than the contribution of individual predator stocks to prey mortality. The estimated trade-offs between yields of forage fish and predator species were highly variable when we assumed joint bottom-up and top-down control on predation. Roughly one-third of this variance was related to an interactive effect of fishing and predation intensity; strong trade-offs were predicted when fishing intensity on forage species is high and when predators account for a high proportion of total forage mortality. When trophic connections were presumed to be driven by bottom-up processes, trade-offs were more predictable, but generally very small. Contrary to our expectations, trade-offs were not easily predicted from energetic properties, largely because predators of forage species exhibited a high degree of intra-guild predation, and also consumed many of the same prey as forage species. Given the limited ability to a priori predict the food-web implications of forage fisheries, we suggest that a precautionary risk-based approach be applied to decisions about acceptable biological removals of forage fish and biological targets used for their management.},

abstract = {Range expansion in north-temperate fishes subsequent to the retreat of the Wisconsinan glaciers has resulted in the rapid colonization of previously unexploited, heterogeneous habitats and, in many situations, secondary contact among conspecific lineages that were once previously isolated. Such ecological opportunity coupled with reduced competition likely promoted morphological and genetic differentiation within and among post-glacial fish populations. Discrete morphological forms existing in sympatry, for example, have now been described in many species, yet few studies have directly assessed the association between morphological and genetic variation. Morphotypes of Lake Trout, Salvelinus namaycush, are found in several large-lake systems including Great Bear Lake (GBL), Northwest Territories, Canada, where several shallow-water forms are known. Here, we assess microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA variation among four morphotypes of Lake Trout from the five distinct arms of GBL, and also from locations outside of this system to evaluate several hypotheses concerning the evolution of morphological variation in this species. Our data indicate that morphotypes of Lake Trout from GBL are genetically differentiated from one another, yet the morphotypes are still genetically more similar to one another compared with populations from outside of this system. Furthermore, our data suggest that Lake Trout colonized GBL following dispersal from a single glacial refugium (the Mississippian) and support an intra-lake model of divergence. Overall, our study provides insights into the origins of morphological and genetic variation in post-glacial populations of fishes and provides benchmarks important for monitoring Lake Trout biodiversity in a region thought to be disproportionately susceptible to impacts from climate change.},

If the life history sf a population consists of a sequence of density-dependent stages linked by density-independent survival rates, and if the density-dependent stages take the form of the Beverton-Hoit stock and recruitment curve, then a single Bevertsn-Holt curve will describe the entire life history. The relationship between the parameters of any stage in the life history and the optimal harvest rate and optimal stock size is analyzed. Increasing survival rates will always increase the optimal harvest rate, but may increase or decrease the optimal stock size. Increasing the habitat capacity will increase the optimal stock size and leave the optimal harvest rate unaffected. An example of changing freshwater survival rates by Salmonid Enhancement is shown, as is an example of changing ocean survival rate. As we acquire a better understanding of the determinants sf survival and habitat capacity, we should adjust harvest rates and stock size as the environment changes.

abstract = {AbstractBayesian alternatives to frequentist propensity score approaches have recently been proposed. However, few studies have investigated their covariate balancing properties. This article compares a recently developed two-step Bayesian propensity score approach to the frequentist approach with respect to covariate balance. The effects of different priors on covariate balance are evaluated and the differences between frequentist and Bayesian covariate balance are discussed. Results of the case study reveal that both the Bayesian and frequentist propensity score approaches achieve good covariate balance. The frequentist propensity score approach performs slightly better on covariate balance for stratification and weighting methods, whereas the two-step Bayesian approach offers slightly better covariate balance in the optimal full matching method. Results of a comprehensive simulation study reveal that accuracy and precision of prior information on propensity score model parameters do not greatly influence balance performance. Results of the simulation study also show that overall, the optimal full matching method provides the best covariate balance and treatment effect estimates compared to the stratification and weighting methods. A unique feature of covariate balance within Bayesian propensity score analysis is that we can obtain a distribution of balance indices in addition to the point estimates so that the variation in balance indices can be naturally captured to assist in covariate balance checking.},

abstract = {Summary Canada has vast quantities of fresh water, covering c. 9% of its land mass, more than any other country in the world. Southern Canada, south of 60°N, has a relatively depauperate freshwater fish fauna with 147 species exclusively fresh water, 48 species that are anadromous and catadromous or have populations in both freshwater and marine systems and 16 introduced species. These fishes are distributed across nine ecoregions as defined by a combination of faunal similarity and major watersheds. Diversity varies substantially across ecoregions due to variability in glacial history, topography, climate and spatial patterns and abundance of lakes, rivers and wetlands. Recreational fisheries are dominant in these fresh waters where c. 3.71???106 anglers contribute Canadian $8.3 billion to the economy. The most popular recreational fish species by catch are Sander vitreus (26%), salmonids (22%), Perca flavescens (17%), basses (12%) and Esox lucius (12%), and 11% other species. Canada has some of the best recreational fisheries in the world, yet there is evidence of local overfishing and collapse, in particular in fisheries closest to large urban areas where they are often maintained through stocking. If the combination of human population growth and angling participation rate continue as they have recently, we can expect to see continuing erosion of fishing quality, particularly within the shadows of large cities. Commercial fishing in Canadian fresh waters is relatively modest in landings and value in contrast to Canadian marine commercial fisheries accounting for c. 3% of the landed volume and 4% of the total landed value (Canadian $68???106) of all Canadian commercial fisheries. Sander vitreus, Coregonus spp., P. flavescens and E. lucius are the primary targets for the Canadian freshwater commercial fishery. Effective management of Canada's fresh water fisheries involves managing harvest, habitat and fish stocks. The richness and diversity of fresh waters and their associated fisheries in Canada provide substantial challenges to sustainable management.

In fisheries, in particular,\ngrowth modelling is fundamental to the management of fish stocks that\ncan constitute important economic resources. The scientific literature\nis abundant in studies attempting to define the growth trajectory of\ndifferent fish species but often little consideration is given to the\necological components of the fish's life history. This review examines\nontogeny of fishes with complex life histories, in particular how\ndifferent phases can effect growth and the interpretation of growth\nmodels. Using the blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) as an example,\nwe explore alternative approaches to understanding growth in a species\nthat undergoes both sex reallocation and ontogenetic vertical migration.\nMore flexible models are required in order to accurately represent\nsignificant lifetime events, specifically accounting for periodical\nchanges in the growth trajectory. Finally, model evaluation and\ninterpretation need to be adequate to the task, particularly when\noutcomes are used to support resource management, in order to address\nconcerns regarding conservation, sustainability, and successful\nmanagement in the long term.},

abstract = {The planetary boundaries framework defined safe limits to human impacts on essential Earth-system processes. Subsequent assessments concluded that impacts exceed most delineated boundaries. Societal responses to these results have been insufficient to restore safety. One factor impeding effective action is differences in scale between planetary boundaries and national, regional, or local scales where many impacts and solutions originate. I have contributed toward a resolution by developing a regional scale framework and an approach to translate boundaries across spatial scales. I developed the framework for a county and river basin in the Pacific Northwest. The framework includes six state variables related to planetary scale analogues. Boundary translation can be achieved by aggregating hydrologic processes across scales. Because of greater process certainty and lower spatial heterogeneity at the regional scale, regional boundaries can be defined with more precision than global analogues. The region has exceeded five boundaries and is close to the remaining one. Effects of existing and proposed policies will be to exceed boundaries further. Likely consequences include irreversible degradation in river functions, severe water shortages, impaired water quality, human health impacts, and extinctions of iconic salmonids. In most cases, policy and enforcement mechanisms to restore conditions within regional boundaries are in place, but they have been ignored or misapplied. New initiatives with potential to restore safety are being pursued by indigenous peoples, who also are most directly affected by boundary transgression. By clearly delineating regional boundaries and identifying consequences of boundary transgression, this framework may complement indigenous efforts with policy imperatives for other stakeholders in the region.},

abstract = {Presence-absence data are used widely in analysis of wildlife-habitat relationships. Failure to detect a species' presence in an occupied habitat patch is a common sampling problem when the population size is small, individuals are difficult to sample, or sampling effort is limited. In this paper, the influence of non-detection of occurrence on parameter estimates of logistic regression models of wildlife-habitat relationships was assessed using analytical analysis and simulations. Two patterns of non-detection were investigated: (1) a random distribution of non-detection among occupied patches; and (2) a non-random distribution of non-detection in which the probability of detecting a species in an occupied patch covaried with measurable habitat variables. Our results showed that logistic regression models of wildlife-habitat relationships were sensitive to even low levels of non-detection in occupancy data. Both analytic and simulation studies show that non-detection yields bias in parameter estimation of logistic regression models. More importantly, the direction of bias was affected by the underlying pattern of non-detection and whether the habitat variable was positively or negatively related to occupancy. For a positive habitat coefficient, a random distribution of non-detection yielded negative bias in estimation, whereas linkage of the probability of non-detection to habitat covariates produced positive bias. For a negative habitat coefficient, the pattern was reversed, with a random distribution of non-detection leading to positive bias in estimation. A release-recapture livetrapping study of small mammals in central Indiana, USA, was used to illustrate the magnitude of non-detection in a typical field sampling protocol with varying levels of sampling intensity. Estimates of non-detection error ranged from 0 to 23% for seven species after 5 days of sampling. We suggest that for many sampling situations, relationships between probability of detection and habitat covariates need to be established to correctly interpret results of wildlife-habitat models. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite progress in the management of assessed fish populations, many countries lag behind international commitments to restore overexploited stocks to healthy abundances. Here we use a mixed-methods positive deviance approach, also known as ‘bright spot' analysis, to understand what drives the successful governance of exploited species by learning from positive outliers, or ‘deviants'. We use Canada as a case study, identifying factors driving the abundance of 230 commercially exploited fish and invertebrate populations, of which only 28% were classified at healthy abundance in 2022. We first applied a generalized linear model to test how diverse socio-ecological fishery attributes relate to stock health. We found healthier stocks are positively and significantly correlated with certain management regions, more selective gears, eco-certification, and high fishery value. Counterintuitively, healthier stocks were also associated with high inherent fishing vulnerability and the absence of reference points. We then used fishery expert surveys and interviews to investigate the social and institutional characteristics of stocks healthier than expected, given their circumstances. We found that fisheries targeting these positive outliers have lower conflict among users, balanced stakeholder involvement in data collection and decision-making, and improved accounting of mortality sources. Lessons from these positive deviants can be applied to improve underperforming management systems that are struggling to reverse overexploitation in Canada and elsewhere. More generally, we suggest that a positive deviance approach, already used in public health, could be a promising tool to learn about successful fisheries management interventions, and the diverse actors responsible for ensuring these interventions are successful.},

abstract = {A major reorganization of the North-east Pacific biota transpired following a climatic 'regime shift' in the mid 1970s. In this paper, we characterize the effects of interdecadal climate forcing on the oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific Ocean. We consider the concept of scale in terms of both time and space within the North Pacific ecosystem and develop a conceptual model to illustrate how climate variability is linked to ecosystem change. Next we describe a number of recent studies relating climate to marine ecosystem dynamics in the NE Pacific Ocean. These studies have focused on most major components of marine ecosystems - primary and secondary producers, forage species, and several levels of predators. They have been undertaken at different time and space scales. However, taken together, they reveal a more coherent picture of how decadal-scale climate forcing may affect the large oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific. Finally, we synthesize the insight gained from interpreting these studies. Several general conclusions can be drawn. 1 There are large-scale, low-frequency, and sometimes very rapid changes in the distribution of atmospheric pressure over the North Pacific which are, in turn, reflected in ocean properties and circulation. 2 Oceanic ecosystems respond on similar time and space scales to variations in physical conditions. 3 Linkages between the atmosphere/ocean physics and biological responses are often different across time and space scales. 4 While the cases presented here demonstrate oceanic ecosystem response to climate forcing, they provide only hints of the mechanisms of interaction. 5 A model whereby ecosystem response to specified climate variation can be successfully predicted will be difficult to achieve because of scale mismatches and nonlinearities in the atmosphere-ocean-biosphere system.},

abstract = {Laying artificial materials on the shore to create refugia that attract crustaceans is a 'fishing' technique known mainly from South America and the UK. In the UK, this method of fishing is known as 'crab-tiling', which involves laying of roof tiles, pieces of guttering or car tyres ('crab-tiles') intertidally in estuaries to provide habitat for Carcinus maenas. Crabs are then harvested for use as angling bait. C. maenas are known to reside under crab-tiles during low tide, however the extent to which crab-tiles influence the distribution and behaviour of crabs and other estuarine fauna during high tide is not clear. To investigate this, fixed underwater video cameras were deployed on a mudflat over two separate occasions in control (non-tiled) and tiled sites. Crabs were significantly more abundant in crab-tiled sites than control sites, and they remained relatively stationary, travelling less in tiled sites than those in control sites. The abundance of mobile fauna (e.g. benthic gobies, mysids, crabs and pelagic fishes) was greater in control sites than in tiled sites during July. The same trend was observed in March but was not significant. Diversity (number of taxa) tended to be greater in control sites than tiled sites on both occasions, but the trend was not significant. The faunal assemblage was not different between control and tiled treatments in either March or July. Crabs occupied crab-tiles throughout high tide immersion, and qualitative observations indicated a tendency to aggressively defend particular tiles. It also seems likely that the tiles provided some protection for the crabs from fish and diving birds. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this study, 50 years of scientific literature were systematically mapped for 11 forage fish species in Canada's Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans. The objectives were to identify (1) knowledge clusters and gaps and (2) the pressures studied in relation to forage fish outcomes. Of the 2897 articles mapped, the majority studied adults and the distribution, productivity, growth, and life history of commercially fished species. Knowledge gaps were identified for forage fish: (1) that were noncommercially exploited; (2) egg and larval life history stages of most species and juveniles of noncommercial species; (3) diets of most species; (4) migration and performance for all species and survival of noncommercial species; and (5) the effects of some pressures (e.g., large-scale climate pressures). Addressing these knowledge gaps would improve the application of EAFMs.},

Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

abstract = {The assessment and management of small pelagic fish (SPF) stocks is particularly difficult and uncertain because their short life expectancy, characteristic aggregative behavior, rapid response to climate and environmental signals and large and variable natural mortality make them less tractable through traditional population dynamic models and assumptions. In this review we summarize the assessment and management approaches applied in 29 SPF stocks or management units (12 anchovy, 10 sardine, 4 herring, and 3 sprat). The review demonstrates that the assessment and management of SPF varies substantially in its approach and performance between stocks and regions. Most stocks have a scientific assessment program in place and a management approach that generally takes into account assessment results, but in some stocks management practices deviate substantially from scientific advice and in some, assessment and management processes are largely disconnected. It is concluded that only properly tailored scientific assessment and management programs can provide the speed of response and the flexibility of management that highly variable SPF demand. The most effective monitoring programs are based on fishery-independent surveys (daily egg production or/and hydroacoustics), while analyses based on catch per unit effort offer limited value. Most assessments, defined as what management uses to base its decisions on, rely on catch-at-age or yield per recruit models. Harvest strategies range from those driven by harvest control rules to those derived from outputs of best assessment runs. Some stocks use operating models based on age–structure model outputs or forward VPA. On the issue of scientific uncertainty some practitioners propose reducing it through additional science and measures, while others promote the development of management procedures robust to uncertainty.},

abstract = {Objective: Managing data-limited populations is a challenge to the sustainability of fisheries globally. Meta-analytic approaches, where insights from data-rich populations are drawn on to inform data-limited ones, along with the use of habitat-based information, have each been proposed as ways to overcome data-limited assessment challenges, but the two approaches have rarely been combined. Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn and rear in many remote coastal watersheds of British Columbia, Canada, challenging comprehensive population assessments. Estimating conservation and management reference points for such populations is particularly relevant given their importance to Indigenous and commercial fisheries. Most Sockeye Salmon have obligate lake-rearing as juveniles, and total abundance is typically limited by production in nursery lakes. Although methods have been developed to estimate population capacity based on the photosynthetic rate of nursery lakes and lake area or volume, they have not yet been widely incorporated into spawner-recruitment analyses. Methods: We tested the value of combining these lake-based capacity estimates with various hierarchical structures in spawner-recruitment analyses to assess population status using a set of Bayesian spawner-recruitment models for 69 populations across coastal British Columbia, many of which were data limited. Results: Our analysis revealed regional variation in the population productivity of Sockeye Salmon, with coastal populations exhibiting slightly lower mean productivity than those in interior watersheds. Hierarchical spawner-recruitment models with and without informative lake habitat-based priors greatly improved predictive ability across all populations. Conclusions: These findings reveal opportunities to integrate spatial analyses of habitat characteristics with population models to inform the conservation and management of exploited species and their natal habitats, particularly where populations are data limited.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors. Journal of Animal Ecology {\textcopyright} 2019 British Ecological Society Plasticity, local adaptation and evolutionary trade-offs drive clinal variation in traits associated with lifetime growth. Disentangling the processes and determinants that cause these traits to vary helps to understand species' responses to changing environments. This is particularly urgent for exploited populations, where size-selective harvest can induce life-history evolution. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are an exploited fish with a life history adapted to low-productivity freshwaters of northern North America, which makes them highly vulnerable to ecosystem changes and overfishing. We characterized life-history variation across a broad and diverse landscape for this iconic northern freshwater fish and evaluated whether clinal variation was consistent with hypotheses for local adaptation or growth plasticity. We estimated growth-associated traits for 90 populations exposed to a diversity of environments using a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model. We tested for clinal variation in their somatic growth, size at maturity and reproductive allocation along environmental gradients of lake productivity, climate, prey and exploitation clines under competing hypotheses of plasticity and local adaptation. Clinal life-history variation was consistent with growth plasticity and local adaptations but not harvest-induced evolution. Variation in somatic growth was explained by exploitation, climate and prey fish occurrence. Increased exploitation, from pristine to fully exploited conditions, led to increased somatic growth (from 32 to 45 mm/year) and adult life spans, and reduced age at maturity (from 11 to 8 years). Variation in size at maturity was explained by climate and, less certainly, prey fish occurrence, while reproductive allocation was explained by evolutionary trade-offs with mortality and other traits, but not environment. Lake trout life-history variation within this range was as wide as that observed across dozens of other freshwater species. Lake trout life histories resulted from evolutionary trade-offs, growth plasticity and local adaptations along several environmental clines. Presuming a plastic response, we documented $\sim$1.4-fold growth compensation to exploitation—lower growth compensation than observed in many freshwater fishes. These results suggest that harvested species exposed to spatially structured and diverse environments may have substantial clinal variation on different traits, but due to different processes, and this has implications for their resilience and successful management.},

The IDH states that diversity of competing species is, or should be expected to be, maximized at intermediate frequencies and/or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. I argue that the IDH has been refuted on both empirical and theoretical grounds, and so should be abandoned. Empirical studies only rarely find the predicted humped diversity-disturbance relationship. Theoretically, the three major mechanisms thought to produce humped diversity-disturbance relationships are logically invalid and do not actually predict what they are thought to predict.

abstract = {We used a stated choice experiment answered by 1335 German anglers and fit latent class models to understand preference heterogeneity where context was accounted for by species choice. Information theoretic approaches were used for model ranking, indicating that a three-class latent class model provided the best fit to the data. The three angler classes differed in centrality to life-style and harvest orientation as well as in the general utility experienced by fishing as opposed to not fishing. Moreover, the three angler types varied in their aversion towards cost, collectively suggesting that the three anglers classes differed by psychological commitment to fishing. The three angler types differed in the importance they attached to a range of attributes across several target species, most notably in relation to cost of fishing, catch-related angling qualities and crowding. Both catch rate and average size of the fish in the catch showed evidence of diminishing marginal utility returns, while the probability of catching trophy fish did not. Although not consistently significant across all target species, the most committed angler class benefited most consistently from size of fish, and the intermediately committed angler group from both catch numbers and size. By contrast, the least committed angler group was largely indifferent to many attributes of the fishing experience. Preferences for catch-related attributes and crowding were most pronounced in experiences targeting pike, carp, eel, zander and “other species”. There were no significant preferences for harvest regulations, stocking frequency and the composition of the catch in terms of wild vs. hatchery fish in any of the three angler types, independent of which species was targeted. Collectively, our study reveals the presence of substantial preference heterogeneity, most notably related to catch-related aspects of the fishing experience, crowding and cost of fishing. These preferences, however, are species- and angler-type dependent. 

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Angler populations are heterogeneous with respect to preferences. Thus, one-size-fits-all policies are unlikely to be optimal for all. Managing freshwater fisheries for high catch rates, large sizes in the catch and limited crowding aligns well with the preferences of more committed anglers across most species and can thus be considered generic management objectives that safeguard high angler well-being of more specialized anglers. Alternatively viewed, alteration of catch prospects and to a lesser degree increased crowding is bound to produce disutility to more specialized anglers, particularly when fisheries move to low catch rates and small fish sizes as fishing pressure rises. Such changes are unlikely to cause large aversion to casual anglers, but this angler group is in the minority compared to more committed fishers, at least in our sample.},

abstract = {Abstract
Hierarchical models can express ecological dynamics using a combination of fixed and random effects, and measurement of their complexity (effective degrees of freedom, EDF) requires estimating how much random effects are shrunk toward a shared mean. Estimating EDF is helpful to (1) penalize complexity during model selection and (2) to improve understanding of model behavior. I applied the conditional Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC) to estimate EDF from the finite‐difference approximation to the gradient of model predictions with respect to each datum. I confirmed that this has similar behavior to widely used Bayesian criteria, and I illustrated ecological applications using three case studies. The first compared model parsimony with or without time‐varying parameters when predicting density‐dependent survival, where cAIC favors time‐varying demographic parameters more than conventional Akaike Information Criterion. The second estimates EDF in a phylogenetic structural equation model, and identifies a larger EDF when predicting longevity than mortality rates in fishes. The third compares EDF for a species distribution model fitted for 20 bird species and identifies those species requiring more model complexity. These highlight the ecological and statistical insight from comparing EDF among experimental units, models, and data partitions, using an approach that can be broadly adopted for nonlinear ecological models.},

abstract = {We construct and explore a general modeling framework that allows for a systematic investigation of the impact of changes in landscape structure on population dynamics. The essential parts of the framework are a landscape generator with independent control over landscape composition and physiognomy, an individual-based spatially explicit population model that simulates population dynamics within heterogeneous landscapes, and scale-dependent landscape indices that depict the essential aspects of landscape that interact with dispersal and demographic processes. Landscape maps are represented by a grid of 50x50 cells and consist of good-quality, poor-quality, or uninhabitable matrix habitat cells. The population model was shaped in accordance to the biology of European brown bears (Ursus arctos), and demographic parameters were adjusted to yield a source-sink configuration. Results obtained with the spatially explicit model do not confirm results of earlier nonspatial source-sink models where addition of sink habitat resulted in a decrease of total population size because of dilution of high-quality habitat. Our landscape indices, which describe scale-dependent correlation between and within habitat types, were able to explain variations in variables of population dynamics (mean number of females with sink home ranges, mean number of females with source home ranges, and mean dispersal distance) caused by different landscape structure. When landscape structure changed, changes in these variables generally followed the corresponding change of an appropriate landscape index in a linear way. Our general approach incorporates source-sink dynamics as well as metapopulation dynamics, and the population model can easily be modified for other species groups.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 British Ecological Society Freshwater fisheries are complex social–ecological systems spatially structured by coupled feedbacks between people and nature. Spatial exploitation dynamics depend on angler preferences for multiple attributes that influence their site choices. Anglers then reciprocally impact local fish populations through size-selective catch and harvest. Thus, feedbacks among angler site choices, their capture efficiency (i.e. catchability) and fish population dynamics permeate through whole landscapes. We studied the coupled feedbacks and effects of spatial exploitation in an iconic northern freshwater fishery of conservation concern. Specifically, we evaluated several coupled feedbacks in the spatially structured Yukon lake trout fishery using a Bayesian multinomial choice model fitted to onsite interviews and fishery-independent population assessments to identify whether: (a) trip context (day vs. multi-day trips) shaped angler preferences and site choices, (b) catch-based quality was influenced by a size–numbers trade-off and density-dependent catchability and (c) fish population structure was associated with the gravity of resource usage resulting from spatial exploitation. Overall, we found that angler site choices were shaped by preferences for multiple characteristics including travel time and catch-based quality. Angler preferences also varied with trip contexts—for example, anglers on day trips were less willing to travel than anglers on multi-day trips. We detected strong density-dependent catchability, which led to hyperstable catches and relatively few anglers dominated most of the catch. There was a strong demographic trade-off between lake trout body size and abundance that appeared to dynamically interact with anglers' size-selective preferences for larger lake trout. Coupled feedbacks among angler site choices, size-selective and hyperstable catches, and density-dependent growth and survival appeared to structure spatial exploitation patterns leading to a halo of depletion in fish body sizes and fishing quality near urban centres. Synthesis and applications. Feedbacks between fish and anglers affected spatial exploitation patterns leading to a halo of depletion in Yukon lake trout. We recommend fisheries' managers consider the size, distance and behaviours of nearby angler communities using measures of gravity to craft policies aligning expected resource usage with spatial conservation risks. Such approaches may help managers balance stakeholder needs with conservation targets across whole ecosystems.},

abstract = {Due to the logistics of monitoring remote and diffuse fisheries, typically only a small portion of the annual fishing effort can be observed, and a random sample is often impractical. We used a large data set (over 250,000 observations) from time-lapse cameras placed at 53 lakes across the province of British Columbia, Canada, to better understand the relative influence of different temporal strata (time of day, day type, and month) on the relative number of fishing boats observed on lakes. The high temporal frequency data available from cameras were used to evaluate alternative effort monitoring and estimation strategies for aerial surveys that are commonly used in recreational fisheries. We tested the predictive performance of simple mean count expansion factors versus generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) under random and stratified (targeting high-effort strata) sampling regimes. Out-of-sample cross validation showed that the current sampling protocol and estimation method (mean count expansion) used for aerial surveys in British Columbia have low predictive power and are biased. A stratified sampling design combined with the GLMM estimator was an efficient strategy that could easily be applied to effort monitoring programs using aircraft. Moreover, the GLMM approach is much more flexible to interpret data obtained from nonstandard sampling regimes and can estimate angler effort over any temporal scale. We outline several summary statistics on accuracy, precision, and bias of estimates at different sample sizes so that managers can evaluate expected precision versus sampling effort in their management jurisdictions. Furthermore, we suggest that our general approach of using camera data to parameterize predictive models applied to data from other low-frequency effort monitoring methods (such as aircraft) can easily be replicated elsewhere.},

abstract = {A graphical equilibrium model, balancing immigration and extinction rates of species, has been developed which appears fully consistent with the fauna-area curves and the distance effect seen in land and freshwater bird faunas of the Indo-Australian islands. The establishment of the equilibrium condition allows the development of a more precise zoogeographic theory than hitherto possible. One new and non-obvious prediction can be made from the model which is immediately verifiable from existing data, that the number of species increases with area more rapidly on far islands than on near ones. Similarly, the number of species on large islands decreases with distance faster than does the number of species on small islands. As groups of islands pass from the unsaturated to saturated conditions, the variance-to-mean ratio should change from unity to about one-half. When the faunal buildup reaches 90% of the equilibrium number, the extinction rate in species/year should equal 2.303 times the variance divided by the time (in years) required to reach the 90% level. The implications of this relation are discussed with reference to the Krakatau faunas, where the buildup rate is known. A 'radiation zone,' in which the rate of intra-archipelagic exchange of autochthonous species approaches or exceeds extraarchipelagic immigration toward the outer limits of the taxon's range, is predicted as still another consequence of the equilibrium condition. This condition seems to be fulfilled by conventional information but cannot be rigorously tested with the existing data. Where faunas are at or near equilibrium, it should be possible to devise indirect estimates of the actual immigration and extinction rates, as well as of the times required to reach equilibrium. It should also be possible to estimate the mean dispersal distance of propagules overseas from the zoogeographic data. Mathematical models have been constructed to these ends and certain applications suggested. The main purpose of the paper is to express the criteria and implications of the equilibrium condition, without extending them for the present beyond the IndoAustralian bird faunas.

Previous studies have compared enhanced versus control sites following habitat enhancements, but no studies have assessed how plant and fish communities change through time in enhanced habitats. We sampled plant and fish communities in two enhanced littoral areas three times each summer from 1998 to 2000. Quality fish habitat (i.e., sandy bottom, moderate coverage of aquatic macrophytes, high dissolved oxygen concentrations) was present in enhanced sites throughout this study. Irrespective of water level, plant abundance (percent area covered, PAC) and biomass increased during the study period, but mean plant biomass and abundance were < 2 kg (.) m(-2) and < 50%, respectively, in 2000. Mean dissolved oxygen concentrations in enhanced sites generally exceeded 3 mg(.)L(-1) in all years. Diverse fish communities also reflected quality habitat in enhanced sites. No fish variables differed between sites, but fish diversity and richness were highest during 1999 when water levels were high. Mean water depth and PAC, when significant, were positively related to fish variables (e.g., biomass, diversity). The results of this study suggest that the benefits of the 1995-96 Lake Kissimmee habitat enhancement were prolonged compared to a previous effort, which may be due, in part, to herbicide treatments.},

Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calcification rates, demography, abundance, distribution, and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species' responses, such as fishing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We find that general trends in species' responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in calcification, and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean acidification. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).},

Systematic overfishing of fresh waters is largely unrecognized because of weak reporting and because fishery declines take place within a complex of other pressures. Moreover, the ecosystem consequences of changes to the species, size, and trophic composition of fish assemblages are poorly understood. These complexities underlie the paradox that overexploitation of a fishery may not be marked by declines in total yield, even when individual species and long-term sustainability are highly threatened. Indeed, one of the symptoms of intense fishing in inland waters is the collapse of particular stocks even as overall fish production rises—a biodiversity crisis more than a fisheries crisis.},

abstract = {In traditional source-sink models, vital rates and movement probabilities are assumed to be temporally homogeneous. Numerous studies, however, have demonstrated that temporal heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception in natural systems. A case of particular interest is an expanding and contracting population where determination of source and sink populations is dependent on the timing and duration at which population growth rates are measured. Thus, ecologists have been perplexed about what is the proper scale to test for source-sink dynamics. In this study, I present a temporally variable source- sink dynamic driven by flooding disturbance. I measured population growth rates of an herbivorous neotropical rolled-leaf beetle, Cephaloleia fenestrata (Chry somelidae), at different temporal scales in this expanding and contracting population. I demonstrate that flooding created a strong sink, but the system lacked source-sink dynamics during nonflood periods. The sink is caused by a flood-related sevenfold decrease in survival probability. There was no evidence for effects of flooding on recruitment. Migration was directional from the upland to the flood zone habitat, supporting the conclusion that the population in the flood zone is a sink. A Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that whether the population in the flood zone is a sink, and the intensity of the sink, ultimately depend on the flooding frequency. Given an observed flood frequency of approximately once per year, the flood zone population was determined to be a long-term sink. This study provides evidence of high temporal variability resulting in fluctuations sin and out of a source-sink dynamic and implicates a causal factor (increased mortality due to flooding). These results illustrate the importance of considering temporal variability in source-sink dynamics, and in choosing the proper temporal scale at which to test for source-sink dynamics.

abstract = {1. Understanding the spatial scale of population structure is fundamental to long-standing tenets of population biology, landscape ecology and conservation. Nonetheless, identifying such scales has been challenging because a key factor that influences scaling – movement among patches or local populations – is a multicausal process with substantial phenotypic and temporal variation. 2. We resolve this problem via a novel application of network modularity. When applied to move-ments, modularity provides a formal description of the functional aggregation of populations and identifies potentially critical scales for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We first test for mod-ularity using several different types of biologically relevant movements across the entire geographic range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). We then ask whether variation in movement based on (i) age, (ii) sex and (iii) time (annual, seasonal and within-season movements) influences spatial population structure (i.e. modularity) in snail kites. 3. We identified significant modularity in annual dispersal of snail kites (all adults, males only, females only, and juveniles only) and in within-breeding season movements of adults, yet no evidence of modularity in seasonal (non-breeding) movements. For those movements with observed modular structure, we found striking similarities in the spatial configuration of population structure, even though movement properties varied considerably among these dif-ferent types of movements. 4. Our results suggest that the emergence of modularity in population networks can be robust despite movement heterogeneity and differences in patch-based measures of connectivity. Fur-thermore, our comparison of the population structure and connectivity across multiple move-ment phases helps to identify wetland patches most critical to population connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales. 5. We argue that understanding modularity in populations may provide a robust complement to existing measures of population structure and connectivity and will help to clarify the lim-iting roles of movement for populations. Such information is increasingly needed for inter-preting population persistence and guiding effective conservation strategies with ongoing environmental change.},

abstract = {In the previous chapter on regression, we focused primarily on the classic setting where the response y is continuous and typically assumed to have a normal distribution, at least approximately. However, in many environmental data analysis examples, the data to be modeled are clearly non-normal. For instance, we may record a binary response (e.g. survived or died, or infected or not infected, etc.) A zero-one variable is clearly non-normal. In many other common examples, the response of interest is a count, e.g. the number of eggs in a nest or number of vines on a tree. The Poisson distribution is often used to model count data and a Poisson regression can be used to relate count responses to predictors. This chapter introduces the generalized linear model to accommodate responses that follow non-normal distributions. The word " linear " appears here because the response is still modeled as a linear combination of predictors but the relation is not necessarily a direct relation as in the previous chapter. Instead, we need to introduce a link function that links the response to the linear predictor. Before defining the generalized linear model, we start by introducing a special case – logistic regression.},

abstract = {Setting social, economic, and ecological objectives is ultimately a process of social choice informed by science. In this special feature we provide a multidisciplinary framework for the use of cumulative effects assessment in land use planning. Forest ecosystems are facing considerable challenges driven by population growth and increasing demands for resources. In a suite of case studies that span the boreal forest of Western Canada to the interior Atlantic forest of Paraguay we show how transparent and defensible methods for scenario analysis can be applied in data-limited regions and how social dimensions of land use change can be incorporated in these methods, particularly in aboriginal communities that have lived in these ecosystems for generations. The case studies explore how scenario analysis can be used to evaluate various land use options and highlight specific challenges with identifying social and ecological responses, determining thresholds and targets for land use, and integrating local and traditional knowledge in land use planning. Given that land use planning is ultimately a value-laden and often politically charged process we also provide some perspective on various collective and expert-based processes for identifying cumulative impacts and thresholds. The need for good science to inform and be informed by culturally appropriate democratic processes calls for well-planned and multifaceted approaches both to achieve an informed understanding of both residents and governments of the interactive and additive changes caused by development, and to design action agendas to influence such change at the ecological and social level. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the author(s).},

abstract = {1. Biological invasions are numerous in fresh waters around the world. At least hundreds of freshwater species have been moved outside of their native ranges by vectors such as ballast water, canals, deliberate introductions, and releases from aquaria, gardens, and bait buckets. As a result, many bodies of fresh water now contain dozens of alien species. 2. Invasions are highly nonrandom with respect to the taxonomic identity and biological traits of the invaders, the ecological characteristics of the ecosystems that are invaded, and the geographical location of the ecosystems that supply and receive the invaders. 3. Some invaders have had deep and pervasive effects on the ecosystems that they invade. Classes of ecologically important invaders in fresh waters include molluscs that are primary consumers and disrupt the food web from its base, fishes that disrupt the food web from its apex or centre, decapods that act as powerful omnivores, aquatic plants that have strong engineering effects and affect the quality and quantity of primary production, and diseases, which probably have been underestimated as an ecological force. 4. The number of alien species in freshwater ecosystems will increase in the future as new aliens are moved outside of their native ranges by humans, and as established aliens fill their potential ranges. Alien species create “no-analogue” ecosystems that will be difficult to manage in the future. We may be able to reduce future impacts of invaders by making more serious efforts to prevent new invasions and manage existing invaders. 5. Thematic implications: interactions between alien species and other contemporary stressors of freshwater ecosystems are strong and varied. Because disturbance is generally thought to favour invasions, stressed ecosystems may be especially susceptible to invasions, as are highly artificial ecosystems. In turn, alien species can strongly alter the hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, and biotic composition of invaded ecosystems, and thus modulate the effects of other stressors. In general, interactions between alien species and other stressors are poorly studied.},

abstract = {This book focuses on the influence of climate variability on the marine ecosystems of the North Atlantic. The ecological impact of climate variability on population dynamics is addressed at the full range of trophic levels, from phytoplankton through zooplankton and fish to marine birds. Climate effects on biodiversity and community structure are also examined. The book discusses what is currently known about how climate affects the ecological systems of the North Atlantic, and then places these insights within a broader ecological perspective. Many of the general features of the North Atlantic region are also seen in other marine ecosystems as well as terrestrial and freshwater systems. The final section of the book makes these generalities more explicit, so as to stimulate communication and promote co-operation amongst researchers who may previously have worked in semi-isolation. The book comprises five main sections: background (general introduction, atmospheric and ocean climate of the North Atlantic, and modelling methodology), plankton populations (phytoplankton and zooplankton), fish and seabird populations, community ecology (phytoplankton, benthos and fish), and the final section consisting of six commentaries from scientists working in areas outside the North Atlantic marine sector. In order to enhance integration, a series of introductions link chapters and sections. Throughout the book, numerous examples highlight different aspects of ecology-climate interactions. They document recent progress and illustrate the challenges of trying to understand ecological processes and patterns in the light of climate variations.},

abstract = {Virtually all studies reporting deepening with increasing size or age by fishes involve commercially harvested species. Studies of North Sea plaice in the early 1900s first documented this phenomenon (named Heincke's law); it occurred at a time of intensive harvesting and rapid technological changes in fishing methods. The possibility that this deepening might be the result of harvesting has never been evaluated. Instead, age- or size-related deepening have been credited to interactions between density-dependent food resources and density-independent environmental factors. Recently, time-dependent depth variations have been ascribed to ocean warming. We use a model, initialized from observations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the eastern Scotian Shelf, where an age-dependent deepening of ∼60 m was observed, to assess the effect of size- and depth-selective exploitation on fish distribution. Exploitation restricted to the upper 80 m can account for ∼72% of the observed deepening; by extending exploitation to 120 m, all of the deepening can be accounted for. In the absence of fishing, the model indicated no age-related deepening. Observations of depth distributions of older cod during a moratorium on fishing supported this prediction; however, younger cod exhibited low-amplitude deepening (10-15 m) suggestive of an ontogenetic response. The implications of these findings are manifold, particularly as they relate to hypotheses advanced to explain the ecological and evolutionary basis for ontogenetic deepening and to recent calls for the adoption of evidence of species deepening as a biotic indicator or “footprint” of warming seas.},

abstract = {Management agencies have increasingly relied on size limits, daily bag or trip limits, quotas, and seasonal closures to manage fishing in recreational and commercial fisheries. Another trend is to establish aquatic protected areas, including no-take reserves (NTRs), to promote sustainable fisheries and protect aquatic ecosystems. Some anglers, assuming that no serious harm befalls the fish, advocate allowing catch-and- release (C&R) angling in aquatic protected areas. The ultimate success of these regulations and C&R angling depends on ensuring high release survival rates by minimizing injury and mortality. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of these practices, we review trends in C&R fishing and factors that influence release mortality. Analysis of Marine Recreational Fishery declined 28% (188.5 to 135.7 ? 106), mean total catch/angler/trip declined 22.1% (0.95 to 0.74 fish), and mean landings/angler/trip declined 27% (0.42 to 0.31 fish). The total number of recreational releases or discards increased 97.1% (98.0 to 193.2 ? 106) and as a proportion of total catch from 34.2% in 1981 to 58.0% in 1999. Evidence indicates that the increased releases and discards are primarily in response to mandatory regulations and to a lesser extent, voluntary releases. Total annual catch and mean annual catch/angler were maintained despite declines in catch per trip because anglers took 30.8% more fishing trips (43.5 to 56.9 ? 106), perhaps to compensate for greater use of bag and size limits. We reviewed 53 release mortality studies, doubling the number of estimates since Muoneke and Childress (1994) reviewed catch and release fishing. A meta-analysis of combined data (n=274) showed a skewed distribution of release mortality (median 11%, mean 18%, range 0–95%). Mortality distributions were similar for sal- monids, marine, and freshwater species. Mean mortality varied greatly by species and within species, anatomical hooking location was the most important mortality factor. Other significant mortality factors were: use of natural bait, removing hooks from deeply hooked fish, use of J-hooks (vs. circle hooks), deeper depth of capture, warm water temperatures, and extended playing and handling times. Barbed hooks had marginally higher mortality than barbless hooks. Based on numbers of estimates, no statistically significant overall effects were found for fish size, hook size, venting to deflate fish caught at depth, or use of treble vs. single hooks. Catch and release fishing is a growing and an increasingly important activity. The common occurrence of release mortality, however, requires careful evaluation for achieving fishery management goals and in some cases, disturbance, injury, or mortality may conflict with some goals of NTRs. Research is needed to develop better technology and techniques to reduce release mortality, to assess mortality from predation during capture and after release, to determine cumulative mortality from multiple hooking and release events, and to measure sub-lethal effects on behavior, physical condition, growth, and reproduction. Statistic Survey (MRFSS) data for 1981–1999 showed no statistically significant U.S. trends for total number of anglers (mean 7.7 ? 106), total catch in numbers (mean 362 ? 106), or total annual catch/angler (mean 42.6 fish).

In the winter all anglers originated from BC, with 93% coming from the Lakes District. The most common angling method on Tchesinkut Lake in the open water fishery and the winter fishery, was using lures only (56% and 98% respectively). A much higher proportion of anglers used lures only in the winter fishery. The preferred species of fish for the majority of anglers in the open water fishery were lake trout and rainbow trout. However, lake trout was overwhelmingly the most popular species in the winter fishery. Anglers spent on average, 3.2 hr/day ( }1.7 (standard deviation)) on Tchesinkut Lake in the summer, but only 2.5 hr/day ( }1.2) in the winter. Fishing effort peaked in July and declined through to October, but increased during the ice fishery. Rainbow trout were by far the most common (63%) fish species caught in Tchesinkut Lake for the open water portion of 2000-01 season. Lake trout were the second most common fish caught at 20% of the total catch, while kokanee constituted only 16% of the catch. In the winter, all but one reported fish caught was a lake trout.

An annual estimate of 775 lake trout and 1,191 rainbow trout was estimated to be harvested from Tchesinkut Lake in 2000-01. Age data were analyzed for lake trout and it was found that the average age of harvested fish was 13.8 years old ( }4.7). The average age of sampled young lake trout ( 15 years old) was younger in 2000-01 than in 1988 (t=2.45, p<0.05), but the lengths were not significantly different (t=1.92, p>0.05), indicating that young lake trout are growing faster than they were 13 years ago.},

Two designatable units are found in BC: the “inside” population occupying the inside waters between Vancouver Island and mainland BC, and the “outside” population occurring in all other BC waters. Yelloweye are found primarily in depths from 20 m to around 300 m coastwide. The inside population occurs over an approximate area of 14,267 km², while the outside population occur over an approximate area of 108,035 km². The maximum length of Yelloweye Rockfish caught in BC is 84 cm, and the maximum weight is 10.9 kg. British Columbia Yelloweye are aged to a maximum of 121 years, with an estimated age of 17 when 50% of individuals are mature. Natural mortality is estimated at 0.038. Average generation time is similar between the inside and outside populations, 42.8 and 42.6 years, respectivley. Yelloweye Rockfish are caught in commercial, recreational and First Nations fisheries in BC. Quotas have been reduced since 2001 to a current overall sector total of 110 t. In 2006 100% monitoring was implemented for BC fisheries. Research surveys have increased for groundfish in BC over the last 10 years providing abundance indices to represent population trends.

Size selection changed from favouring fast growth in the 1970s to favouring slow growth in the late 1980s and 1990s.

The intensity of size selection declined at the end of the study period following the closure of the commercial fishery.

abstract = {Inherent in the carrying capacity notion is the basic idea of a maximum population a particular level of resources can support over a period of time. Knowledge of carrying capacity is essential for wildlife conservation since it is intrinsic in determining how much habitat must be conserved to maintain healthy populations. Further, this concept has been the cornerstone of the management of exploited animal and plant populations. Yet the question about what determines carrying capacity for territorial species and how it can be quantified has been long neglected by ecological research. We propose a novel method to model carrying capacity dynamics for territorial salmonids, which can be further applied to any territorial species as long as they are principally limited by habitat conditions. In our model, maximum abundance is limited by environmentally induced fluctuating habitat conditions and regulated through territorial behaviour. Carrying capacity is estimated as the amount of habitat available divided by the expected individual territory area for a given life stage. We tested whether the model was capable of explaining the annual fluctuations in densities of brown trout Salmo trutta from 12 Mediterranean populations for a 12-year study period. We observed not only that density of the different life stages tracked carrying capacity dynamics, but also that the eventual cohort performance was affected by both intercohort competition and intensity of intracohort competition experienced in the previous year. Likewise, recruitment depended on the levels of carrying capacity saturation experienced by adult stock the year before. In any case, resilience decreased with carrying capacity. Such results suggest that restoration measures attempting to increase population abundance through stocking, increased breeding dispersion or cohort survival may reduce the performance of both the enhanced and competing cohorts. Further, high exploitation rates may lead populations occurring at low carrying capacities to extinction. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Food webs unfold across a mosaic of micro and macro habitats, with each habitat coupled by mobile consumers that behave in response to local environmental conditions. Despite this fundamental characteristic of nature, research on how climate change will affect whole ecosystems has overlooked (i) that climate warming will generally affect habitats differently and (ii) that mobile consumers may respond to this differential change in a manner that may fundamentally alter the energy pathways that sustain ecosystems. This reasoning suggests a powerful, but largely unexplored, avenue for studying the impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. Here, we use lake ecosystems to show that predictable behavioral adjustments to local temperature differentials govern a fundamental structural shift across 54 food webs. Data show that the trophic pathways from basal resources to a cold-adapted predator shift toward greater reliance on a cold-water refuge habitat, and food chain length increases, as air temperatures rise. Notably, cold-adapted predator behavior may substantially drive this decoupling effect across the climatic range in our study independent of warmer-adapted species responses (for example, changes in near-shore species abundance and predator absence). Such modifications reflect a flexible food web architecture that requires more attention from climate change research. The trophic pathway restructuring documented here is expected to alter biomass accumulation, through the regulation of energy fluxes to predators, and thus potentially threatens ecosystem sustainability in times of rapid environmental change.},

abstract = {Canada has experienced a significant increase in the transport of diluted bitumen (dilbit), a predominant oil sands product that combines bitumen with diluents derived from oil-gas condensates and other proprietary compounds. The toxicity of dilbit to fish embryos, which are immobile and thus at a high risk of exposure to oil in the event of a spill, remains largely unknown for most species. This study assessed the toxicity of water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAF) of two winter dilbit blends, Access Western Blend (AWB) and Cold Lake Blend (CLB), to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos. The TPH-F EC50s for malformations were 834 and 1058 $\mu$g/L for AWB WAF and CEWAF, respectively, and 500 and 715 $\mu$g/L for CLB WAF and CEWAF, respectively. Levels of cyp1a mRNA increased up to 46- and 69-fold, respectively, reflecting increasing exposure to polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in AWB and CLB. Similarly, levels of gst mRNA were elevated up to 3.8-fold and 2.7-fold with increasing total concentrations of PACs in AWB and CLB, respectively. However, there were no significant changes in mRNA levels of p53, sod, cat, and gsr. These results suggest that the expression of cyp1a and gst may serve as biomarkers for dilbit exposure in fathead minnow, furthering our understanding of dilbit-responsive indicators of toxicity in fish species native to North America. This study is important as it utilizes the same exposure methodology to examine the toxicity of two commonly used Canadian dilbits, facilitating comparison of dilbit toxicity.},

abstract = {1 The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2 Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3 Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4 At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5 Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed. [References: 47] English Article},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach to stock assessment determines the probabilities of alternative hypotheses using information for the stock in question and from inferences for other stocks/species. These probabilities are essential if the consequences of alternative management actions are to be evaluated through a decision analysis. Using the Bayesian approach to stock assessment and decision analysis it becomes possible to admit the full range of uncertainty and use the collective historical experience of fisheries science when estimating the consequences of proposed management actions. Recent advances in computing algorithms and power have allowed methods based on the Bayesian approach to be used even for fairly complex stock assessment models and to be within the reach of most stock assessment scientists. However, to avoid coming to ill-founded conclusions, care must be taken when selecting prior distributions. In particular, selection of priors designed to be noninformative with respect to quantities of interest to management is problematic. The arguments of the paper are illustrated using New Zealand's western stock of hoki, Macruronus novaezelandiae (Merlucciidae) and the Bering--Chukchi--Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales as examples},

abstract = {1. Geostatistical data—spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon— are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate. 2. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package's use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software. 3. We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization). 4. We hope that sdmTMB's user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

Lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are a common demersal fish on the west coast of North America and are exploited both commercially and recreationally across the entirety of their range. Due to stock declines, Lingcod are managed using a variety of fisheries management tools, including spatial management. This study represents a unique in situ investigation of demersal habitat utilization by Lingcod at the southern portion of their range (Point Arena to Morro Bay, California). ROV and towed camera sled derived underwater video imagery were coupled with high-resolution bathymetry data and evaluated using Generalized Linear Models to investigate: a) how Lingcod are distributed relative to seafloor habitats along California's central coast, b) the extent to which any ontogenetic patterns varied across habitats, and c) how associations based on visual observations compare to those from landscape modeling analysis. The results of this study clearly depicted an ontogenetic shift in Lingcod habitat utilization. Lingcod shifted from primarily low relief, soft sediments as young to mixed substrates at intermediate ages and ultimately to primarily harder substrates as adults. These results are important in the context of on-going marine spatial planning wherein further information on the habitat associations of targeted species can allow for more refined management.},

abstract = {The way in which density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal are key in determining the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations. Here we propose a mechanistic approach to understanding how the relative importance of these sources of density dependence can change over ontogeny through changes in dispersal abilities, energy stores and mortality risks. Whereas the potential for active dispersal typically increases over ontogeny as a function of body size, susceptibility to starvation and predation decreases. The joint effect of these mechanisms suggests a general model for the ontogenetic sequence of how density dependence is manifested, with density dependence early in ontogeny being primarily expressed as mortality on local spatial scales, whereas later stages respond to local density in terms of dispersal and potentially growth. Here we test this model by manipulating the densities of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at two life-history stages in the wild. Density-dependent mortality during the early juvenile stage (i.e. fry at onset of exogenous feeding) was accompanied by no effects on body size and weak effects on dispersal. In contrast, dispersal of older juveniles (i.e. parr 2-3 months after onset of feeding) was strongly density-dependent, with more individuals emigrating from high-density release sites, and with no effect of initial density on mortality. This dispersal, however, appeared insufficient to produce an ideal free distribution within the study stream, as indicated by the effect of spatial variation in density on body size by the end of the first growth season. These results demonstrate that the way density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal changes throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, these changes occur in correlation with changes in individual mortality risks and dispersal abilities, and suggest a general paradigm for the way in which juvenile density-dependence is manifest in spatially structured populations of highly fecund organisms},

This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis.

abstract = {Management of recreational fisheries involves understanding how anglers interact with the fishery resource. Managers must understand the source (spatial distribution), efficiency, and behavior of angler effort in order to develop optimal management strategies in a social-ecological framework. We interviewed anglers (n = 1,956) and assessed fish populations in 21 lakes that are part of a multistock, spatially structured fishery for Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. Our objective was to assess the spatial behavior, harvest behavior, and catch efficiency of anglers and to understand the strengths of interactions between anglers and fish populations in three regions within this large fishery. Our results suggest a diverse angler population that varied in its behavior and its impact on the fishery. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified four distinct angler groups based on three variables that directly described how anglers interacted with the fishery (spatial distribution, catchability, and harvest behavior). Angler characteristics varied between groups, and the relative proportions of the four discrete angler groups varied among management regions. Substantial variation in angler characteristics across groups and variation in the relative distribution of the groups across regions imply that a one size fits all management approach is not optimal for this fishery. Instead, strategies that are attuned to angler characteristics would constitute a better approach for managing this large, spatially structured fishery.

Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gsmpertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier fomulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.},

We tested the hypothesis that spawning-stock variation exists in age-at-maturity for this species using a Bayesian approach to incorporate and compare the support for different growth models and maturity scenarios considered for the western spawning stock. The biphasic Lester Model out-performed the uniphasic von Bertalanffy model and showed good fits for describing individual growth variability in Atlantic bluefin tuna. The Lester Model provided estimates of individual age-at-maturity and spawning, from which spawning ogives were generated and compared to two reproductive scenarios currently considered for the western spawning stock; either an early (age at 50 % maturity at 4 years) or late maturity scenario (age at 50 % maturity at 10). The results derived from the Lester Model demonstrate a lack of stock-specific variation in reproductive dynamics for Atlantic bluefin tuna, and provide support for an early maturity scenario for the western spawning stock.},

abstract = {Elucidating connections between ocean climate variability and change and recruitment of juvenile fishes to adult populations is critical for understanding variability in stock–recruit dynamics. Recruitment to adult rockfish populations in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) is highly variable, leading to short-and long-term changes in abundance, productivity, forage availability, and potential fisheries yield. We used regional ocean model output, oceanographic data, and a 34-year time series of pelagic juvenile rockfish to investigate the interaction between changes in CCE source waters, as reflected by physical water mass properties, and recruitment variability. Specifically, variability of “spiciness” on upper water isopycnals explains a substantial fraction of the variation in pelagic juvenile rockfish abundance. High rockfish abundances correspond to cooler, fresher waters with higher dissolved oxygen (i.e., “minty”) conditions, indicative of Pacific subarctic water. By contrast, years of low rockfish abundance are associated with warmer, more saline, and more oxygen-deficient (i.e., “spicy”) conditions, reflecting waters of subtropical or equatorial origin. Transport and source waters in the CCE are key factors determining density-independent processes and subsequent recruitment to adult populations.},

abstract = {Natural mortality can substantially affect fish population dynamics, but the rate is difficult to estimate because natural deaths are rarely observed and it is difficult to separate the effects of natural and fishing mortality on abundance. We developed a new telemetry approach for estimating natural and fishing mortality rates and applied it to the population of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Gaston, North Carolina and Virginia. Our analyses were based on a sample size of 51 telemetered striped bass that were known to be alive and in Lake Gaston at least 1 month after capture and surgery. Relocations of live fish and fish that died of natural causes were used to estimate natural and fishing mortality rates and the probability of relocating telemetered fish. Fishing mortality rates varied seasonally, but few natural deaths were observed, so the best model incorporated a constant annual instantaneous natural mortality rate (M; +/- SE) of 0.14 +/- 0.02. With the uncertainty in model selection accounted for, the average annual M was 0.16 +/- 0.04 For 1997 and 0.12 +/- 0.04 for 1998. Estimated annual fishing mortality rates (F) were 0.74 +/- 0.13 for 1997 and 0.34 +/- 0.18 for 1998. This telemetry approach for estimating mortality rates does not rely on angler reporting of tagged fish. The relative standard errors for;M (24-33%) were comparable to those obtained from traditional ragging methods with large sample sizes. This approach is most applicable in closed systems, where fishing mortality estimates are not biased by emigration. A high relocation probability is critical to reliably establishing seasonal changes in mortality.},

abstract = {The effects of bait species (mackerel and squid) and color (blue-dyed and non-dyed) on the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta bycatch in a pelagic longline fishery in the western North Pacific were assessed in shallow-set longline fishing experiments. The loggerhead turtle catches were analyzed using a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution. The potential factors (bait species, bait color, other species catch, and sea surface temperature) affecting loggerhead turtle catch were incorporated as explanatory variables. The model analyses indicated that bait species affected loggerhead turtle catch, while bait color did not. The model predicted that catch rates of loggerhead turtles were 75% less on mackerel bait to squid bait. This study demonstrated that fish bait choice was very effective in reducing loggerhead turtle bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries, but that the use of blue-dyed bait was not. Similar model analyses were also performed on target and by-product fish species, such as swordfish Xiphias gladius, striped marlin Tetrapturus audax, bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, blue shark Prionace glauca, and shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus, and other non-target species. The remarkable differences between bait species and color that were found for loggerhead turtles were not found for these species catches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The most popular method for estimating PRM employs containers for comparing control and treatment fish, yet guidance for experimental design of PRM studies with containers is lacking. We used simulations to evaluate trade-offs in the number of containers (replicates) employed versus the number of fish-per container when estimating tagging mortality. We also investigated effects of control fish survival and how among container variation in survival affects the ability to detect additive mortality. Simulations revealed that high experimental effort was required when: (1) additive treatment mortality was small, (2) control fish mortality was non-negligible, and (3) among container variability in control fish mortality exceeded 10% of the mean. We provided programming code to allow investigators to compare alternative designs for their individual scenarios and expose trade-offs among experimental design options. Results from our simulations and simulation code will help investigators develop efficient PRM experimental designs for precise mortality assessment. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {A framework is developed for the provision of scientific advice to support the management of new and developing marine invertebrate fisheries. These fisheries often occur on species for which little biological or exploitation information is available. The framework explicitly endorses the precautionary approach to fisheries management and research. Three general management strategies (size/sex limits, regulation by total allowable catch, control of the exploitation rate) and their needs for supporting scientific information are identified. The significance of spatial pattern, and of recognizing the need for different approaches to obtain scientific information and to manage sedentary benthic and mobile pelagic species, is a central theme. Three 'phases' are proposed to obtain the necessary scientific information: (a) Phase 0, 'collecting existing information', consisting of syntheses of available biological and fisheries information on the target (and similar) species, leading to formulation of potential management strategies; (b) Phase 1, 'collecting new information', to obtain the essential information that is lacking or insufficient from the Phase O analysis, and to evaluate alternative management strategies and propose regulatory actions; and (c) Phase 2, 'fishing for commerce', to implement the chosen management actions and to monitor fishing operations, so as to increase the information base available to refine the results from previous phases. Phase 1 activities may consist of surveys, site-specific depletion experiments and studies to obtain biological information, and development of experimental management areas to test different exploitation rates. A strategy that includes establishing reserve areas recognises the inherent uncertainties associated with developing fisheries and provides a buffer against mistakes or 'surprises'; it also provides control areas to compare stock productivity in fished and unfished locations. The application of this framework to a developing sea cucumber fishery in British Columbia is presented as an example. Throughout, strong interaction and collaboration among science, management, and stakeholders is crucial to the provision of scientific advice for precautionary management of new invertebrate fisheries.},

abstract = {Life history diversity of imperiled Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. substantially contributes to their persistence, and conservation of such diversity is a critical element of recovery efforts. Preserving and restoring diversity of life history traits depends in part on environmental factors affecting their expression. We analyzed relationships between annual hydrograph patterns and life history traits (spawn timing, age at spawning, age at outmigration, and body size) of Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to identify environmental indicators of current and historic diversity. Based on mean monthly flow patterns, we identified three hydrologic regimes: snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, and transitional. Chinook populations in snowmelt-dominated areas contained higher proportions of the stream-type life history (juvenile residence >1 year in freshwater), had older spawners, and tended to spawn earlier in the year than populations in rainfall-dominated areas. There are few extant Puget Sound populations dominated by the stream-type life history, as several populations with high proportions of stream-type fish have been extirpated by construction of dams that prevent migration into snowmelt-dominated reaches. The few extant populations are thus a high priority for conservation. The low level of genetic distinction between stream-type and ocean-type (juvenile residence <1 year in freshwater) life histories suggests that allowing some portion of extant populations to recolonize habitats above dams might allow re-expression of suppressed life history characteristics, creating a broader spatial distribution of the stream-type life history. Climate change ultimately may limit the effectiveness of some conservation efforts, as stream-type Chinook may be dependent on a diminishing snowmelt-dominated habitat.},

However, the effects of biotic and abiotic variables on body condition have not been evaluated at local scales, which is important given spatial heterogeneity. We evaluate changes in distribution, experienced environmental conditions, and individual-level condition of cod in relation to covariates at different spatial scales using geostatistical models with spatial and spatiotemporal random effects. Sprat, Saduria entomon, temperature and oxygen were positively associated with condition, and depth was negatively associated. However, the effects of explanatory variables were small - spatial and spatiotemporal latent variables explained 5.7 times more variation than all covariates together (year excluded). Weighting environmental oxygen with local biomass densities revealed steeper declining trends compared to the unweighted oxygen in the environment, while the effect of weighting was less clear for condition. Understanding the drivers of spatiotemporal variation in body condition is critical for predicting responses to environmental change and to effective fishery management; yet low explanatory power of covariates on individual condition constitutes a major challenge.},

Such fishing is proposed to result in higher catches with less negative impact on exploited populations and ecosystems. This study examines the models and the empirical evidence put forward in support of BH. It finds that the models used unrealistic settings with regard to life history (peak of cohort biomass at small sizes), response to fishing (strongcompensation of fishing mortality by reduced natural mortality), and economics (uniform high cost of fishingand same ex-vessel price for all species and sizes), and that empirical evidence of BH is scarce and questionable. It concludes that evolutionary theory, population dynamics theory, ecosystem models with realistic assumptions and settings, and widespread empirical evidence do not support theBH proposal. Rather, this body of evidence suggests that BH will not help but will hinder the policy changes needed for the rebuilding of ecosystems, healthy fish populations, and sustainable fisheries},

abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis can be a useful method for improving estimation of key parameters for harvested fish populations. In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

abstract = {Growing degree-days (GDD, degrees C.days) are an index of ambient thermal energy that relates directly to an ectotherm's cumulative metabolism but is rarely used to describe growth and development in fish. We applied GDD to length and maturity data from 416 populations of walleye (Sander vitreus) from Ontario and Quebec, Canada (mean annual GDD = 1200 to 2300 degrees C.days). On average, males matured after they had experienced 6900 degrees C.days and reached 350 mm total length (L) (n = 77 populations), and females matured after 10 000 degrees C.days and at 450 mm L (n = 70). Across 143 populations, GDD accounted for up to 96% of the variation in the length of immature walleye but also revealed a twofold difference in growth rate that was indicative of variation in food availability. When applied to data from eight populations in which walleye abundances have changed dramatically over time, GDD revealed a 1.3-fold increase in immature growth rate when abundance was low compared with when it was high. Our results both demonstrate the explanatory power of GDD with respect to fish growth and maturity and inform the development of regional management strategies for walleye.},

abstract = {A new method for estimating individual variability in the von Bertalanffy growth parameters of fish species is presented. The method uses a nonlinear random effects model, which explicitly assumes that an individual's growth parameters represent samples from a multivariate population of growth parameters characteristic of a species or population. The method was applied to backcalculated length-at-age data from the tropical emperor, Lethrinus mahsena. Individual growth parameter variability estimates were compared with those derived using the current "standard" method, which characterizes the joint distribution of growth parameter estimates obtained by independently fitting a growth curve to each individual data set. Estimates of mean von Bertalanffy growth parameters from the two methods were similar. However, estimated growth parameter variances were much higher using the standard method. Using the random effects model, the estimated correlation between population mean values of L-infinity and K was -0.52 or -0.42, depending on the marginal distribution assumed for K. The latter estimate had a 95% posterior credibility interval of -0.62 to -0.17. These represent the first reliable estimate of this correlation and confirm the view that these parameters are negatively correlated in fish populations; however, the absolute correlation value is somewhat lower than has been assumed.},

abstract = {Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.},

abstract = {Rapidly developing and complex climate change impacts have profound implications for coastal communities, demanding adaptation actions for both social and ecological systems. Along the coast of British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the 1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge. Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3) promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4) developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government, including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts, indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to marine resources and territorial management rights.},

abstract = {Reproduction in social organisms is shaped by numerous morphological, behavioural and life-history traits such as body size, cooperative breeding and age of reproduction, respectively. Little is known, however, about the relative influence of these different types of traits on reproduction, particularly in the context of environmental conditions that determine their adaptive value. Here, we use 14 years of data from a long-term study of wolves (Canis lupus) in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to evaluate the relative effects of different traits and ecological factors on the reproductive performance (litter size and survival) of breeding females. At the individual level, litter size and survival improved with body mass and declined with age (c. 4-5 years). Grey-coloured females had more surviving pups than black females, which likely contributed to the maintenance of coat colour polymorphism in this system. The effect of pack size on reproductive performance was nonlinear as litter size peaked at eight wolves and then declined, and litter survival increased rapidly up to three wolves, beyond which it increased more gradually. At the population level, litter size and survival decreased with increasing wolf population size and canine distemper outbreaks. The relative influence of these different-level factors on wolf reproductive success followed individual > group > population. Body mass was the primary determinant of litter size, followed by pack size and population size. Body mass was also the main driver of litter survival, followed by pack size and disease. Reproductive gains because of larger body size and cooperative breeding may mitigate reproductive losses because of negative density dependence and disease. These findings highlight the adaptive value of large body size and sociality in promoting individual fitness in stochastic and competitive environments.},

Log-log regressions of R on E showed little evidence of eff ects of density (within CUs) on survival, implying that habitat capacity does not presently limit Fraser sockeye abundance. Shared survival among CUs, the fi rst principal component of log(R/E), accounted for 46% of the variance, remarkable given the wide variety of freshwater and marine habitats experienced by the CUs. Six low-survival events in six decades accounted for much of the shared survival pat-tern. The r 2 values for Ricker models were low, indicating that attempts to manage and/or assess Fraser sockeye using Ricker curves fi t to individual CUs will, in general, face low explanatory power. A suite of increasingly complicated Bayesian regressions, based on the Beverton-Holt model, quantifi ed the precision of capacity esti-mates, but these were always imprecise and the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) indicated over-fi tting in all but the simplest models. A variance factor for the relative precision of estimates of R, based on the proportion of spawners from each CU in groups of co-migrating CUs (i.e., runs), was eff ective only in models in which WAIC indicated over-fi tting. Improving the precision of capacity estimates for Fraser sockeye salmon, using similar models, will require mobilizing biological knowledge (i.e., historical metadata) about each CU, including estimates of abundance with identifi ed precision and indicators of habitat capacity at multiple life-history stages including the abundance of potential competitors in marine habitats. Researchers analyzing stock recruitment data for salmon populations and other species are strongly encouraged to pay attention to factors aff ecting the various categories of data in their models, i.e., to examine the associated metadata.},

abstract = {The North Pacific Ocean is warming and overall Pacific salmon abundance is higher now than at any other time in the past century. This increase in abundance is in large part due to warming-related changes in marine ecosystems at northern latitudes that primarily benefit pink salmon, and industrial-scale hatchery production to support commercial fisheries. A large body of evidence indicates that increasing and more variable ocean temperatures, as well as competition among salmon at sea, are associated with shifts in salmon productivity, body size, and age at maturation. However, these relationships vary by species, location, and time, resulting in increased harvest opportunities in some regions and exacerbated conservation concerns in others. The weight-of-evidence suggests North Pacific salmon nations should, as a minimum, limit further increases in hatchery salmon production until there is a better scientific understanding of hatchery and wild salmon distribution at sea, how they interact, and how the consequences of these interactions are influenced by broader climate and ecosystem conditions. Coordinated research to overcome knowledge gaps and develop strategies to reduce unintended interactions between hatchery and wild salmon could be funded (in part) by a tax placed on industrial-scale hatchery salmon releases. A tax would formalize recognition that there are finite prey resources to support salmon in the ocean and that both prey and wild salmon represent a “common property” whose use should not be without cost to those that seek to benefit from them. We highlight additional approaches salmon nations can take to adapt to changing conditions and suggest that improved communication and collaboration among North Pacific salmon research and management agencies will be key to balancing the benefits and risks of a warming and more crowded ocean.},

Archaeologists have relied on the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) application of cost surface analysis and the computation of least cost paths (LCP) to study movement, one key social process. Recent research has identified limitations with LCP for modeling nonhuman species movement, notably the inability of LCP to accommodate multiple pathways. Archaeology must consider the implications of these critiques for models of past human movement. In this paper, I apply a different approach, circuit theory modeling, enacted through the program Circuitscape, to an archaeological case study previously analyzed with LCP modeling, travel to a regionally significant ceremonial earthwork center during Late Prehistory (ca. AD 1200-1600) in the Northern Great Lakes. Through this comparative analysis, I evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for modeling past movement. The results suggest LCP modeling and circuit modeling offer archaeology complementary geospatial methods for conceptualizing past mobility. Combining circuit theory and LCP allows archaeologists to produce richer models of past movement by appreciating scenarios where multiple pathways are important as well as scenarios where optimum single travel routes have priority. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Land-use change is the largest proximate threat to biodiversity yet remains one of the most complex to manage. In British Columbia (BC), where large mammals roam extensive tracts of intact habitat, continued land-use development is of global concern. Extant mammal diversity in BC is unrivalled in North America owing, in part, to its unique position at the intersection of alpine, boreal, and temperate biomes. Despite high conservation values, understanding of cumulative ecological impacts from human development is limited. Using cumulative-effects-assessment (CEA) methods, we assessed the current human footprint over 16 regional ecosystems and 7 large mammal species. Using historical and current range estimates of the mammals, we investigated impacts of human land use on species' persistence. For ecosystems, we found that bunchgrass, coastal Douglas fir, and ponderosa pine have been subjected to over 50% land-use conversion, and over 85% of their spatial extent has undergone either direct or estimated indirect impacts. Of the mammals we considered, wolves were the least affected by land conversion, yet all species had reduced ranges compared with historical estimates. We found evidence of a hard trade-off between development and conservation, most clearly for mammals with large distributions and ecosystems with high levels of conversion. Rather than serve as a platform to monitor species decline, we strongly advocate these data be used to inform land-use planning and to assess current conservation efforts. More generally, CEAs offer a robust tool to inform wildlife and habitat conservation at scale.},

abstract = {Aim: To assess how climate change may decouple the ecosystems used by a migratory fish, and how decoupling influences priorities for stream restoration. Location: Australia. Methods: We modelled changes in habitat suitability under climate change in both riverine and marine habitats for a threatened diadromous species, the Australian Grayling Prototroctes maraena, using niche models. The loss of riverine habitats for Grayling was compared with or without considering the impact of climate change on adjacent marine habitats. We also asked whether considering marine climate change changed the locations where removing dams had the greatest benefit for Grayling conservation. Results: Climate change is expected to cause local extinction in both marine and river habitats regardless of whether dams are retained or removed at the trailing edge of the Grayling's range (north-eastern). Decoupling of habitats was most apparent in the eastern and south-eastern portion of the Grayling's range, where ocean warming may cause a decline in the suitability of marine habitats for larvae, while many freshwater habitats retained suitable habitat for adults. Removing dams to restore connectivity between ocean and freshwater habitats was predicted to have the greatest benefit for Grayling in southern portions of their range. Under climate change, the priorities for barrier removal gradually shift towards dams at higher elevation because of increasing suitability of freshwater habitats at higher elevations. Main conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of assessing climate range shifts in multiple ecosystems for migratory species and can help inform priorities for stream restoration under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Anadromy and homing are two traits found widely amongst teleost fishes. They co-occur in salmonid fishes, and probably also in other fish families. Anadromy provides fish with the opportunity for more rapid growth, larger size, and higher fecundity through the exploitation of rich food resources and favourable growing temperatures in the sea, but may result in higher predation mortalities and has the tendency to disperse stocks very widely. Homing fosters adaptation of stocks to favourable local spawning conditions, but the dispersive effects of anadromy, in the absence of homing, may tend to break down such local adaptation. A low percentage of straying in species that home may have long-term evolutionary advantages. This paper explores the question of whether homing may be a preadaptation for successful evolution of anadromy, or whether the two attributes have coevolved.},

abstract = {Connectivity among populations and habitats is important for a wide range of ecological processes. Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes (such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

abstract = {The classical tools in spatial statistics are stationary models, like the Mat{\'{e}}rn field. However, in some applications there are boundaries, holes, or physical barriers in the study area, e.g. a coastline, and stationary models will inappropriately smooth over these features, requiring the use of a non-stationary model. We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on viewing the Mat{\'{e}}rn correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite. The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Additionally, the Barrier model is better at reconstructing the modified Horseshoe test function than the standard models used in R-INLA.},

abstract = {Forage fish play a pivotal role in marine ecosystems and economies worldwide by sustaining many predators and fisheries directly and indirectly. We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of forage fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of forage fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of forage fisheries and (iii) the support service of forage fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about $16.9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i.e. 20% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was $5.6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable ($11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates of economic value reported herein understate the global value of forage fishes. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Fish welfare issues are increasingly appearing on social and political agendas and have recently gained prominence in fisheries literature. By focusing on examples from recreational fishing, this paper challenges some of the previous accounts of fish welfare. Issues of concern encompass: (1) the feelings-based approach to fish welfare; (2) the artificial divide between human beings and nature; and (3) ways in which stakeholders can address fish welfare issues. The different approaches to characterizing the interaction of humans with animals are animal welfare, animal liberation and animal rights. We show that the suffering-centred approaches to fish welfare and the extension of the moral domain to fish – characteristic of the concepts of animal liberation and animal rights – are not the cornerstone of animal welfare. This, however, does not question the need of fisheries stakeholders to consider the well-being of fish when interacting with them. There are many ways in which recreational fishing stakeholders can modify standard practices to improve the welfare of fish, without questioning fishing as an activity per se. Examples are choice of gear and handling techniques. Previous accounts have failed to include discussions of the many efforts – voluntary or mandated – pursued by fisheries stakeholders to reduce fish stress, injury and mortality. Progress towards addressing fish welfare issues will be enhanced by avoiding the viewing of humans as ‘non-natural' disturbance to fishes and keeping three types of crucial question in separate compartments. The three questions cover the symptoms of good and poor welfare, the conscious experience of suffering, and the ethical attitudes towards animals. Fish biologists should focus on the first question – objective measurement of biochemical, physiological and behavioural indicators – to evaluate whether human interactions with fish impair the latters' health or prevent them from receiving what they need, if held in captivity.},

The current environmentally informed control rule modifies the harvest rate for the northern sardine subpopulation based on average sea surface temperatures measured during California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations field cruises. This rule prioritizes catch at intermediate biomass levels but may increase variability in catch and closure frequency compared to alternative control rules, especially if recruitment is unrelated to ocean temperatures. Fishing at maximum sustainable yield and using dynamically estimated reference points reduced the frequency of biomass falling below 150 000 mt by up to 17\%, while using survey index-based biomass estimates resulted in a 14\% higher risk of delayed fishery closure during stock declines than when using assessment-based estimates.},

While previous efforts to describe homing, or natal site fidelity, of migratory organisms have been hindered by the confounding effects of fragmented landscapes and management practices, realistic conservation efforts must include considerations of the behavioral diversity represented by animal movements and dispersal. Herein, we quantify straying away from natal origins by adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in a wild population that inhabits a pristine wilderness basin. Using natural isotopic signatures (7Sr/86Sr) to reconstruct the migratory behaviors of unhandled individuals over their entire life cycle, we identified ecological and behavioral factors influencing the propensity to stray. Our results indicate that natal site fidelity is scale dependent, ranging from 55% at -1-km distances to 87% at longer (> 10-km scale) distances, and juvenile dispersal and sex highly influence straying occurrence. These findings lend support for the conservation of behavioral diversity for population persistence, and we propose straying as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity at low population densities.},

abstract = {British Columbia steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations showed coherent patterns of adult recruitment until the 1990s, when recruitment patterns diverged between northern and southern British Columbia rivers. From 1963 until 1990 the patterns of temporal change in adult steelhead recruitment was similar for rivers in all regions of British Columbia. In both the Keogh River steelhead population (in southern B.C.) and coho salmon (O. kisutch) in Oregon, the evidence clearly indicates that the overall recruitment response since 1977 was primarily shaped by changes in marine (not freshwater) survival. These changes appear to occur both suddenly and show considerable persistence. A possible reason for the change is that ocean productivity declined in southern B.C. after 1990, reducing the marine growth of juvenile salmon. Although the reasons for the sudden decline in ocean survival of coho salmon and steelhead are unclear, there is very good evidence that sudden climatic changes in the ocean have had a major impact on their productivity.

Motivated by the natural organization of population data intomultiple groups, this paper presents a novel hierarchical gen- erative statistical model on shapes. The proposed method represents shapes using pointsets and defines a joint distribution on the population's (i) shape variables and (ii) object-boundary data. The proposed method solves for optimal (i) point locations, (ii) correspondences, and (iii) model-parameter values as a single opti- mization problem. The optimization uses expectation maximization relying on a novelMarkov-chain Monte-Carlo algorithmfor sampling inKendall shape space.

A model is developed to examine how animals with limited abilities to perceive differences in patch quality affect an IFD by foragers. This constraint produces the observed bias, a bias that is exaggerated as the number of patches increases. Sutherland (1983) has developed a model based on interference which can also explain the observed bias. The two models can be differentiated in that only the perception limit model (this paper) is sensitive to absolute changes in overall resource availability and to increases in the number of animals. Additionally, Sutherland's model predicts that when deviations away from an IFD occur there will be no differences in intake rates, while the perception limit model predicts that intake rates should vary between patches.},

abstract = {To better understand and predict Oregon coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) marine survival, we developed a conceptual model of processes occurring during four sequential periods: (1) winter climate prior to smolt migration from freshwater to ocean, (2) spring transition from winter downwelling to spring/summer upwelling, (3) the spring upwelling season and (4) winter ocean conditions near the end of the maturing coho's first year at sea. We then parameterized a General Additive Model (GAM) with Oregon Production Index (OPI) coho smolt-to-adult survival estimates from 1970 to 2001 and environmental data representing processes occurring during each period (presmolt winter SST, spring transition date, spring sea level, and post-smolt winter SST). The model explained a high and significant proportion of the variation in coho survival (R2 = 0.75). The model forecast of 2002 adult survival rate ranged from 4 to 8%. Our forecast was higher than predictions based on the return of precocious males ('jacks'), and it won't be known until fall 2002 which forecast is most accurate. An advantage to our environmentally based predictive model is the potential for linkages with predictive climate models, which might allow for forecasts more than 1 year in advance. Relationships between the environmental variables in the GAM and others (such as the North Pacific Index and water column stratification) provided insight into the processes driving production in the Pacific Northwest coastal ocean. Thus, coho may be a bellwether for the coastal environment and models such as ours may apply to populations of other species in this habitat.},

abstract = {A network of 14 meteorological stations was installed across the Annapurna range before the 1999 monsoon season, and expanded to 19 stations encompassing 28 rain gauges in 2000. Rainfall is totalled every 30 min. 'Look-down' distance rangers and gray loggers measure snow depth and total water content, respectively, once a day at high elevations (.2,500 m in the Greater Himalaya). Only liquid precipitation is measured in the Tibetan zone, such that the annual (but not the monsoon) total is underestimated here. The data presented here (Fig. 2b) represent monsoon averages based on the longest record available from each station. Apatite fission-track dating Following mineral separation, apatites were polished, etched and irradiated. Standard and induced track densities were determined on Brazil ruby muscovite external detectors (geometry factor 0.5), and fossil track densities were determined on internal mineral surfaces. Ages were calculated using z ¼ 359 ^ 20 for dosimeter glass CN-5. All ages are central ages and are reported with 1j errors. Long-term erosion rates are conservatively estimated on the basis of the fission-track age, and assuming a geothermal gradient of 100 8C km 21 and an annealing temperature of 140 8C. Topographic analysis A 3-arcsec (,90 m) digital elevation model (DEM) is the basis of all topographic analyses. Hillslope angles are calculated at every pixel in the DEM based on a 3 {\pounds} 3 pixel (,180 {\pounds} 180 m) grid. Mean hillslope angles were extracted from a moving, 5-km-radius window centred on the Marsyandi River. Maximum, minimum and mean elevation (Fig. 2) were calculated along a 50-km-wide swath oriented perpendicular to the strike of the range and centred on the Marsyandi River (or the Nar-Phu River above its confluence with the Marsyandi). Equilibrium-line altitude Glacial areas were calculated from present and reconstructed ice margins mapped on aerial photographs, and transferred first to 1:50,000 scale topographic maps and then to the digital topography. Based on glacial hypsometry, equilibrium-line altitudes were estimated with an assumed accumulation-area ratio of 0.65. To avoid uncertainty introduced by avalanches on to glaciers from adjacent high peaks, 29 small glaciers (95% are ,2.5 km 2), lacking high headwalls, were analysed. The regional equilibrium-line altitude gradient shows little sensitivity to accumulation-area ratios ranging from 0.4 to 0.8. Specific stream power Analysis was focused on catchments ranging from 3 to 7 km 2 within the non-glaciated part (,4,200 m elevation) of the study area. These basins drain approximately half of the landscape and are sufficiently large to be fluvial, as opposed to colluvial/debris flow, channels. Monsoon rainfall was smoothed across the meteorological network to define an average precipitation gradient perpendicular to the strike of the topography. This gradient was then extrapolated parallel to strike across the study area. For each river segment $500 m long, channel gradients (S) were extracted from the DEM, and discharge (Q) was calculated as the product of upstream area and rainfall. Discharge is overestimated because all rainfall is assumed to enter channels. Channel width (W) is calculated as 10 22 Q 0.4. Specific stream power (in GJ m 22 yr 21) is calculated as r w gQS/W, where r w is the density of water and g is gravitational acceleration. Channel gradients and specific stream power are binned every 5 km.},

Such inforrkaaticsn, along with catch and spawning essapen-rent data from different parts of the coast, provides the basis far assessing year-to-year variations in production and effects of stock management. The ages of chinook salmon caught in a fishery are akvays estimated by examination of their scales. However, as the salmon reach maturity (on the spawning grounds), most scales are resorbed and total age cannot, therefore, be estimated. At spawning, salmon cease feeding and the scale material Is utilized by the fish, resulting in loss sf annuli near the periphery of the scale. While ages have beerr estimated using stoliths in other salmon species (Clutter and Whitesel 1956; Binton and Jenkinssn 1968; Flain 1982), chi nook salmon otsliths from ing, sampling, and preservation suggest that it may now be possible to distinguish freshwater annuli on the fin rays sf chinook salmon. We suspect, however, that there may be some Qeterioratis$\sim$n of the fin rays over time among the chinook spawners. Samples taken from hatchery brc$\sim$od stock fish at the tinme of egg-take appear to be of better quality than those taken after die-off on the spawning grcsunds. Moreover, the readi-bility of the growth pattern of fin rays that are frozen when stored is often clearer than that of rays that are stored dry. However, furtl$\sim$er study of both aspects is required. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method of estimating both the freshwater and ocean age of chinook salmon spawners from exan-rinatlc$\sim$n of the dorsaE fin ray grc$\sim$wth pattern. The use of known-age (coded-wire tagged) fish provided evidence of the validity of this anethod of age detemination. stocks along the Pacific coast of Canada are often opaque and Materials and Methods therefore unreadable.

abstract = {The evolution of behaviour patterns used in animal conflicts is discussed, using models based on the theory of games. The paper extends arguments used by Maynard Smith & Price (1973) showing that ritualized behaviour can evolve by individual selection. The concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy, or ESS, is defined. Two types of ritualized contests are distinguished, "tournaments" and "displays"; the latter, defined as contests without physical contact in which victory goes to the contestant which continues longer, are analyzed in detail. Three main conclusions are drawn. The degree of persistence should be very variable, either between individuals or for the same individual at different times; a negative exponential distribution of persistence times is predicted. Individuals should display with constant intensity, independent of how much longer they will in fact continue. An initial asymmetry in the conditions of a contest can be used to settle it, even if it is irrelevant to the outcome of a more protracted conflict if one were to take place. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

Samples were obtained along a 37° latitudinal gradient and partitioned among anadromous, normal lacustrine, and dwarf lacustrine Arctic charr morphotypes. Models relating length-at-age or age-specific growth rates to latitude were estimated for each morphotype. Length-at-age declined with latitude for anadromous and lacustrine charr. Age-specific growth rates also varied with latitude, particularly for normal lacustrine charr. Results of analyses provide support for the counter-gradient hypothesis in growth performance of normal lacustrine morphotypes, where northern populations compensate for the shorter growth season with a greater rate of growth than southern populations. Anadromous charr exhibited equivocal evidence of countergradient variation, while results for dwarf lacustrine Arctic charr populations were inconclusive owing to the limited range of ages, and latitudes for which data were available.},

abstract = {Hydro-acoustic surveys have been used to provide annual estimates of May recruitment and November spawner biomass of the South African sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resources since 1984. These time-series of abundance estimates form the backbone of the assessment of these resources, and consequently the management of the South African sardine and anchovy is critically dependent on them. Upgrades to survey equipment over time have resulted in recent surveys providing more accurate estimates of abundance, yet in order to maintain comparability across the full time-series, estimates of biomass mimicking the old equipment were used for a number of years. In this paper we develop a method to revise the earlier part of the time-series to correct for receiver saturation in the older generation SIMRAD EK400 and EKS-38 echo sounders and to account for attenuation in dense sardine schools. This is applied to provide a revised time-series of biomass estimates for the South African sardine and anchovy resources with associated variance-covariance matrices. Furthermore, the time-series presented here are based on updated acoustic target strength estimates, making this the most reliable time-series currently available for both resources.

abstract = {By significantly changing size-dependent mortality, fisheries can cause rapid evolution toward earlier maturation in harvested species. Because earlier maturation negatively affects biomass yield and sustainability, ignoring evolutionary changes could significantly reduce the success of fisheries management policy. With a quantitative genetic model of size at maturation that incorporates phenotype plasticity, we examine the impact of different management strategies including traditional effort control and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). After verifying the model's accuracy, using historical trajectories for size at maturation in cod (Gadus morhua), we test model predictions under different management schemes with life history parameters for red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and two rockfish species (Sebastes paucispinis and S. ruberrimus). The model results show that notake MPAs can protect against strong fisheries-based selection for earlier maturation. The potential to protect against anthropogenic selection declines with increasing fragmentation of reserves to networks of small reserves. Accounting for the evolution of size at maturation increases the predicted biomass contribution from MPA populations to harvested populations. Traditional management approaches, such as adjustments to harvest rate and maximum size limits, can lead to equivalent protection against anthropogenic selection and equivalent or greater long-term biomass yield than establishing MPAs; however, the protection and yield from establishing no-take MPAs appears more robust to uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We examined how population diversity influenced response diversity and asynchrony in 42 populations of Chinook salmon from the Fraser River, British Columbia. We examined diversity in the survival responses to large-scale ocean climate variables for populations that differed in life history. Different life-histories responded differently to ocean environmental conditions. For instance, an increase of offshore temperature was associated with decreased survival for a population with ocean rearing juveniles but increased survival for a population with stream rearing juveniles. In a second analysis, we examined asynchrony in abundance between populations, which we then correlated with life history, spatial, and genetic diversity. Populations that were more genetically distant had the most different population dynamics. Collectively, these results suggest that fine-scale population diversity can contribute to the asynchrony and response diversity that underpins the stability of fisheries or metapopulation dynamics, and emphasize the need to manage and conserve this scale of population diversity.},

abstract = {Climate change impacts coastal ecosystems through large scale changes in temperature, stratification, circulation and ocean acidification. Here, the potential response of the British Columbia continental margin to climate change is investigated using a regional ocean circulation-biogeochemical model to downscale climate change projections from the Canadian regional and global climate models (CanRCM4/CanESM2) under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Projections of future physical and biogeochemical conditions for the 2041–2070 period are compared to the recent past (1981–2010). We found an overall annual average warming of >1.6°C in sea surface temperature, increase in stratification in the upper layer, and decrease in surface pH of as much as 0.21. Increasing stratification and changing winds have a limited impact on nitrate availability, phytoplankton biomass and primary production, whilst ocean warming increases primary production by up to 30% in most of the model domain. Increased atmospheric CO2 contributes to acidification over the model domain with a decrease in pH and aragonite saturation ($\Omega$arag) at all depths resulting in an increase of 20 to 32% of the volume of $\Omega$arag ≤1 in the upper 100 m of the continental shelf depending on the climate scenario. Our projected results, therefore, show that future climate change may alter the amount of food available for higher trophic levels and the habitat of benthic species, since bottom waters on the shelf will be undersaturated with respect to aragonite for 2–3 months in mid-summer. Both climate change scenarios results in a similar pattern of changes but projected changes were stronger and more extensive under RCP 8.5 showing the benefit of mitigation efforts in reducing the effect of climate change on marine ecosystem stressors.},

abstract = {Management of spatially structured species poses unique challenges. Despite a strong theoretical foundation, practitioners rarely have sufficient empirical data to evaluate how populations interact. Rather, assumptions about connectivity and source–sink dynamics are often based on incomplete, extrapolated, or modeled data, if such interactions are even considered at all. Therefore, it has been difficult to evaluate whether spatially structured species are meeting conservation goals. We evaluated how estimated metapopulation structure responded to estimates of population sizes and dispersal probabilities and to the set of populations included. We then compared outcomes of alternative management strategies that target conservation of metapopulation processes. We illustrated these concepts for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River, USA. Our description of spatial structure for this metapopulation was consistent with previous characterizations. We found substantial differences in estimated metapopulation structure when we had incomplete information about all populations and when we used different sources of data (three empirical, two modeled) to estimate dispersal, whereas responses to population size estimates were more consistent. Together, these findings suggest that monitoring efforts should target all populations occasionally and populations that play key roles frequently and that multiple types of data should be collected when feasible. When empirical data are incomplete or of uneven quality, analyses using estimates produced from an ensemble of available datasets can help conservation planners and managers weigh near-term options. Doing so, we found trade-offs in connectivity and source dominance in metapopulation-level responses to alternative management strategies that suggest which types of approaches may be inherently less risky.},

Despite this, insufficient information exists for Celtic Seas sprat, one of five North-East Atlantic stocks, to estimate stock status. To ensure the sustainable exploitation of sprat, the health of the Celtic Seas ecosystem, and the wider fisheries sector, we conduct a management strategy evaluation to stress test the current single-species advice framework. The aim is to evaluate whether ecosystem objectives can be achieved under single-species maximum sustainable yield and precautionary advice frameworks. An operating model was conditioned on life history theory and strategic information from ecosystem models. We showed that in-year advice using an empirical rule could achieve management objectives and help balance the trade-offs between fishing activities and ecosystem health. The approach allows ecosystem understanding to be incorporated within existing precautionary and maximum sustainable yield frameworks to provide a robust management framework that can meet multiple objectives despite uncertainty.},

abstract = {To improve the understanding of linkages between ocean conditions and salmon productivity, we estimated effects of ocean temperature on survival rates of three species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) across 120 stocks. This multistock approach permitted more precise estimates of effects than standard single-stock analyses. The estimated effects were opposite in sign between northern and southern stocks and were quite consistent across stocks within species and areas. Warm anomalies in coastal temperatures were associated with increased survival rates for stocks in Alaska and decreased survival rates in Washington and British Columbia, suggesting that different mechanisms determine survival rates in the two areas. Regional-scale sea surface temperatures (SST, within several hundred kilometres of a stock's ocean entry point) were a much better predictor of survival rates than large-scale climate anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), suggesting that survival rates are primarily linked to environmental conditions at regional spatial scales. With appropriate cautions, these results may be used to predict the potential effects of climatic changes on salmon productivity in different areas of the Northeast Pacific.},

abstract = {Pilchard (sardine) and anchovy are the main targets of South Africa's pelagic fishery. This fishery is the country's second most valuable in monetary terms, and produces the highest annual yield in terms of landed mass (in recent years, a combined catch of the order of 400 000 t). It is the most dynamic of South Africa's main commercial fisheries, because the species targeted are relatively short-lived, often occur in mixed shoals, and experience large fluctuations in abundance. Mixed shoaling causes operational problems for the fishery, because of the inevitability of juvenile pilchard bycatch (of more value as adults for canning) in the anchovy-directed fishery. This operational interaction implies a trade-off between allowable catches for the two species, and hence necessitates that they are managed together. The development of a joint "management procedure" (sensu IWC) for the two species is described. This provides a framework for quantifying this trade-off, subject to the constraint that acceptable levels of risk of "collapse" are not exceeded for either resource. Important new features incorporated in a revision of the procedure implemented in 2002, which have made appreciably enhanced catches from the resources possible, are described.

abstract = {Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exhibit substantial life history variation range-wide and at a local scale. This study addresses two hypotheses that have been proposed to account for this: (i) over the zoogeographic range, climatic conditions are associated with life history differences; and (ii) within smaller geographic regions, physical lake attributes are associated with life history differences. Multivariate statistics (Procrustean analysis and canonical correlation analysis) identified a strong, range-wide association between climate and life history variables. Colder climates were associated with slower prematuration growth, older age at maturity, and increased longevity. Winter conditions were also important; longer, warmer winters were associated with slower prematuration growth, smaller maximum sizes, and increased weight at a standard length of 425 mm. In southern populations, these general trends were further modified by physical lake attributes. High productivity lakes had lake trout with faster prematuration growth and larger maximum sizes; deeper lakes were associated with larger maximum sizes and later ages at maturity; and larger lakes were associated with slower prematuration growth, greater longevity, and larger maximum sizes. This study identifies abiotic variables that should be incorporated into existing lake trout management models, thus extending their applicability range-wide and permitting them to deal with possible impacts of climate change.},

They couple a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with an individual-based model in which an evolutionary-based reproductive strategy for adult fish and a passive transport for early life stages are implemented. The evolutionary success of spawning is quantified when patterns at the population level emerge after many generations from constraints at the individual level through a selective process. As a result, several self-sustaining populations are identified considering different sets of selective constraints. Simulated spawning patterns better match the observed mean spawning pattern when two selective environmental constraints are associated: a threshold temperature of 14degreesC, above which the development of early life stages is ensured, and the avoidance of offshore currents that constitute a loss of spawning products. Simulated recruitment patterns are more realistic when considering the constraint of reaching the nursery area. This modeling experience can help to identify, temporally and spatially, environmental factors important for fish recruitment and to establish a hierarchy of these factors. The probable coexistence in nature of several self-sustaining populations of pelagic fishes is shown to be important for recruitment studies.},

There are, however, few examples where climate change has been considered in MPA network design. In this paper, we assess how climate change considerations were integrated into the design of a newly released MPA network in the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, and then evaluate the resulting network against projected physical and biogeochemical changes and biological responses. We found that representation, replication, and size and spacing recommendations integrated into the design phase were met in most cases. Furthermore, despite varying degrees of projected changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen, and aragonite saturation across the MPA network, suitable habitat for demersal fish species is projected to remain in the network despite some redistribution among sites. We also found that mid-depth MPAs are particularly important for persistence, as fish are projected to move deeper to avoid warming in shallower areas. Our results highlight that a representative MPA network with adequate replication, that incorporates areas of varying climate change trajectory, should buffer against the impacts of climate change.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Crayfish are amongst the most frequently introduced non-native aquatic organisms, with well-documented negative effects on a large number of freshwater taxa. Many crayfish-control strategies make use of manual removal by trapping, a method known preferentially to remove the largest individuals, leaving the juvenile population almost entirely untrapped. 2. Removal by trapping may be used in an attempt to delay colonisation of new stretches by invasive crayfish. It is, however, unclear what effects trapping may have on movement distances of crayfish in wild populations. We examine the impacts of removal by trapping on the movements of American signal crayfish in two UK rivers. 3. We studied four 100 m stretches of two rivers, the Evenlode and Thame, comprising two removal and two non-removal stretches. Each river supported both treatments. Half of the crayfish captured from the removal sections were removed and humanely destroyed by freezing, and half were marked with their trap location and released there. All crayfish captured from the non-removal sections were marked and returned at the point of capture. 4. Mean movement distances were smaller in the removal stretches than the non-removal stretches, both within capture sessions (10.8 and 16.0 m, respectively) and between sessions (14.5 and 24.6 m, respectively), suggesting that removal trapping resulted in the remaining crayfish making smaller movements. Larger crayfish under both treatments made substantially larger movements than those with smaller carapace lengths, both within capture sessions (range 7.6–19.6 m) and between range capture sessions (range 8.9–32.6 m). 5. The results of this study are consistent with expectations if removal by trapping lowered population densities, which we speculate may have affected movement distances directly or indirectly through increasing the availability of food and shelter. 6. This study suggests that trapping at the margins of a population may be sufficient to delay colonisation of new stretches by: (i) maintaining low densities and therefore reducing movements, and (ii) preferentially reducing the population of large individuals, which make the largest movements. However, it remains unlikely that any trapping programme can entirely prevent emigration ⁄dispersal, and therefore colonisation, by signal crayfish.},

For those who experienced the conflict at first hand, its hardships, the passions it evoked and the ideals around which it was fought, the process has tended to remain incomplete. Both sides have constructed their own opposing - Machiavellian and Manichean alike - narratives of the era, apportioned blame to adversaries and their foreign patrons, and, in the case of the victors, sought to safeguard the spoils of their 'triumph' by discriminating against the vanquished. Fifty years on, the lean and sterile Gold War accounts of the civil war, with their unashamedly polemical and partisan underpinnings, their subscription to the 'good vs. evil' moral cliche, and their castigation of one side and vindication of the other, have been replaced by a burgeoning corpus of works on Greece of the 1940s.},

@article{Foldvik2010,
abstract = {1. Spatial within-population heterogeneity in density probably affects competition intensity and may have a fundamental role in shaping population dynamics and carrying capacity. This may be particularly relevant for organisms where limitations on juvenile mobility cause maternal choice of breeding locations to influence the spatial distribution of younger life stages. 2. In this study, we mapped redd locations and the resulting densities of juveniles the following year along the entire reach (9{\textperiodcentered}2km) of a river holding natural populations of anadromous salmonids (Atlantic salmon and brown trout). These data were used to quantify the spatial scale over which breeding influences juvenile densities, and hence becomes important for density-dependent processes. 3. Although the observed cumulative distributions indicated a relatively uniform distribution of breeding along the river, autocorrelation analyses identified spatial patchiness of both breeding and resulting juveniles on a local scale. Furthermore, cross-correlations suggested a close spatial relationship between distribution of redds and juveniles. 4. Using spatially explicit hockey-stick stock-recruitment functions, we found juvenile salmonid density to be mostly influenced by the amount of breeding upstream of a given location. This influence decreased rapidly within the first 75-150 m. Thus, female choice with regard to breeding location gave rise to a heterogeneous distribution of offspring on a spatial scale of almost two orders of magnitude finer than that of the whole population (9{\textperiodcentered}2km). 5. The results are consistent with smaller scale experimental studies of salmonids, and emphasize the role for maternal choice of breeding locations in causing substantial spatial heterogeneity in juvenile densities within natural populations. Due to effects of density heterogeneity on overall levels of competition, this adds another layer of complexity to the dynamics of salmonid populations even in populations where breeding appears to be relatively uniformly distributed through space, and potentially also for a range of other organisms where juvenile dispersal is constrained. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors.

However, in spite of its potential, spatial ecology has not yet fully incorporated tools and concepts from network theory. In the present study, we identify a large spatial network of temporary ponds, which are used as breeding sites by several amphibian species. We investigate how the structural properties of the spatial network change as a function of the amphibian dispersal distance and the hydric conditions. Our measures of network topology suggest that the observed spatial structure of ponds is robust to drought (compared with similar random structures), allowing the movement of amphibians to and between flooded ponds, and hence, increasing the probability of reproduction even in dry seasons.},

abstract = {Fraser Sockeye survival has been low in the last three years (2015-2017). Most of these salmon would have been deposited in the gravel as eggs from 2011 to 2013, migrated to the Northeast (NE) Pacific Ocean as smolts from 2013 to 2015, and returned to spawn as adults from 2015 to 2017. During this period, unusually warm land and ocean temperatures have been observed. In the NE Pacific, a ‘warm blob' developed late 2013 and persisted through to 2016, characterized by anomalously warm waters 3-4°C above seasonal averages and extending down to 100 m depths in some regions. A strong El Ni{\~{n}}o also occurred from 2015 to 2016, which also contributed to warmer land-ocean temperatures in local Pacific and British Columbia waters. Fraser River temperatures were warmer than average in spring and summer months during this period, and spring freshets were particularly early in 2015 and 2016. Although exact temperatures experienced by salmon throughout their life will vary, along with their specific responses, warmer conditions are generally linked to poorer salmon survival. In the ocean, for example, warm coastal ocean temperatures during and following salmon ocean entry are associated with reduced survival of salmon stocks in BC and Washington (Mueter et al. 2005), and warm conditions as early as one year prior to outmigration may influence juvenile growth (Beamish and Mahnken 2001). Fraser Sockeye that will return in 2018 will have experienced many of these same freshwater and marine warm conditions as recent returns (2015-2017). Fraser Sockeye forecasts are presented as standardized cumulative probabilities (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90%) to capture inter-annual random (stochastic) uncertainty in returns, largely attributed to variations in stock survival. The probability distribution for each stock generally spans the range of survival it has exhibited historically for a given brood year escapement, with forecast values at the lower probability levels representing lower observed stock survivals, and values at the higher probability levels representing higher observed survivals. Total Fraser Sockeye returns have either been near or below the 50% probability level forecast for the past 13 years, excluding 2010, indicating average to below average survival for this aggregate during this period. In the last three return years (2015-2017), total Fraser Sockeye returns have fallen at the lowest (10%) probability level forecast, consistent with very poor survival. The combined Fraser Sockeye forecast for 2018 has a median estimate of 14 million, which is similar to the long-term average return for this cycle line (13.1 million), and above the all-year average (7.4 million). At the lower end of the forecast distribution, the forecast for 2018 is 5.3 million at the 10% probability level and 8.4 million at the 25% probability level. Warm temperatures in BC freshwater and Pacific marine ecosystems have occurred in recent years, coinciding with poor total Fraser Sockeye survival. If these recent trends in Fraser Sockeye survival persist, then 2018 total returns are likely to be at the lower (10%-25%) probability level forecast. At the individual stock level, however, responses are likely to vary. Pre-season fisheries' planning considers a range of possible return outcomes based on the forecast distribution, with some emphasis on lower p-levels (10%-25%) in recent years. In-season management decisions are based on in-season data, compared with forecast parameters. The effects of extremely warm water temperatures on survival have been incorporated quantitatively into the forecasts for eight stocks where temperature covariate models historically perform well (Early Stuart, Bowron, Chilko, Quesnel, Raft, Cultus, Weaver, Birkenhead). Together, these eight stocks account for 24% to 32% of the total 2018 forecast, depending on the probability level. Incorporating temperature covariates into these forecasts reduced the total forecast by only 17%, since most of the total forecast was not informed by these warmer temperature data. Additionally, since not all stocks will exhibit similar survival, the forecast distribution for total Fraser River Sockeye salmon will likely over-estimate total returns, particularly at the high probability levels, and it is more appropriate to reference individual stock forecast distributions, versus the total summed forecast. The Late Run Shuswap stock dominates the 2018 forecast (50% at the median probability level). Unlike the 2016 and 2017 forecasts, the Larkin model was not specifically chosen to generate the Late Shuswap forecast, as the extremely large 2010 brood year escapement is no longer expected to impact survival of this stock. Instead, the Ricker-cyc model (see Table 4) was used based on the model selection criteria. The Larkin model forecast is slightly lower than the selected Ricker-cyc model, though it is similar to the Ricker model forecasts, which means that this difference is not due to delayed-density dependence. The Summer Run Chilko (16%) and Quesnel (8%) stocks are the next largest contributors to the 2018 forecast. Usually a smolt-power model is used to generate Chilko forecasts. However, given smolt data were only available for the 2014 brood year, and not the 2013 brood year, a blended smolt-sibling model was used. Specifically, four year olds were forecast with a smolt- power model, and five year olds were forecast using a four-to-five year old sibling model (using preliminary four year old returns in 2017 to predict five year old returns in 2018). The five year old forecast for Chilko is very small, due to the low return of four year old fish in 2017. Quesnel was forecast using the same model as 2017: a Ricker model using sea-surface temperature measured at the Entrance Island lighthouse station. This addition of the Entrance Island covariate in this model has a strong effect on the forecast for Quesnel, reducing it by more than 50%. However, preliminary return estimates for 2017 indicate that this model performed very well under similar environmental conditions as those used to generate the 2018 forecast. The remaining stocks are expected to contribute a total of 26% of the forecast, dominated by Stellako (4%), Seymour (4%), and Scotch (2%). This Science Response Report results from the Science Response Process of December 15, 2017 on Pre-season abundance forecast for Fraser River Sockeye returns in 2018. The 2018 forecast relies on methods of past CSAS processes and publications (Cass et al. 2006; DFO 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014a, 2014b, 2015a, 2015b, 2016, 2017; Grant et al. 2010; Grant and MacDonald 2012, 2013; MacDonald and Grant 2012).},

abstract = {The prevalence of infection and susceptibility of the aquatic oligochaete Tubifex tubifex to Myxobolus cerebralis, was examined in 2 studies on the upper Colorado River, Colorado, USA, where whirling disease occurs in wild trout populations. In the first study, the prevalence of infection ranged from 0.4 to 1.5%, as determined by counting the number of T. tubifex releasing triactinomyxons of M. cerebralis directly following their collection from the field. The susceptibility of those T. tubifex not releasing triactinomyxons was assessed by the number of these oligochaetes releasing triactinomyxons 3 mo following experimental exposures to spores of M. cerebralis. The prevalence of infection following experimental exposures of these T. tubifex ranged from 4.2 to 14.1%. In a second study, all T. tubifex collected at 2 different times directly from the 2 field sites in Colorado were exposed to spores of M. cerebralis. Individual oligochaetes representing those groups of T. tubifex releasing and those groups not releasing triactinomyxons at 3 mo were screened with molecular genetic markers. T. tubifex populations found at the 2 study sites consisted of 4 genetically distinct lineages that varied with respect to their susceptibility to experimental exposure to M. cerebralis. Lineages I and III contained the most oligochaetes susceptible to M. cerebralis and were the most prominent lineages at Windy Gap Reservoir, a site of high infectivity for wild rainbow trout on the upper Colorado River. In contrast, at the Breeze Bridge site which is below Windy Gap Reservoir and where M. cerebralis infections are less severe in wild trout, oligochaetes in lineages V and VI that are resistant to M. cerebralis were more prominent. These results suggest that certain habitats, such as Windy Gap Reservoir, are conducive to large and more homogenous populations of susceptible T. tubifex lineages that may serve as point sources of infection for M. cerebralis. Although not a direct objective of this study, there was no evidence of M. cerebralis infections among any oligochaetes other than those that would be classified as T. tubifex by standard morphological characteristics.},

abstract = {The governance framework for wild-capture fisheries varies widely across the world, but most frameworks generate and use science advice in decision-making, developed with some level of peer-review. The Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) oversees the peer-review process of science related to the management of Canada's fisheries and oceans; the resultant publications with science advice are the main source of scientific evidence used in decision-making in Canada's fisheries. The CSAS has a publicly available policy intended to ensure transparency and timely dissemination of publications that is currently under review. To examine the effectiveness of the existing policy, inform its revision and development of similar policies in other jurisdictions, this paper evaluates the timeliness of the publication of scientific information to support the management of Canada's fisheries and oceans from recent CSAS meetings against current policy deadlines. It was found that from 2017 to 2019, implementation of the policy was poor, with most documents published late, if at all. Furthermore, the science advice considered most during fisheries management decision-making was often not publicly available until after the decision was made and communicated. Despite having a policy to promote transparency, public engagement in policy and decision-making is being limited and a common understanding of the science evidence underlying advice inhibited. Transparency, which is becoming a cornerstone principle in modern fisheries management, is being compromised in Canadian fisheries management.},

abstract = {Biological invasions of aquatic plants (i.e., macrophytes) are a worldwide phenomenon, and within the last 15 years researchers have started to focus on the influence of these species on aquatic communities and ecosystem dynamics. We reviewed current literature to identify how invasive macrophyte species impact fishes and macroinvertebrates, explore how these mechanisms deviate (or not) from the accepted model of plant-fish interactions, and assess how traits that enable macrophytes to invade are linked to effects on fish and macroinvertebrate communities. We found that in certain instances, invasive macrophytes increased habitat complexity, hypoxia, allelopathic chemicals, facilitation of other exotic species, and inferior food quality leading to a decrease in abundance of native fish and macroinvertebrate species. However, mechanisms underlying invasive macrophyte impacts on fish and macroinvertebrate communities (i.e., biomass production, photosynthesis, decomposition, and substrate stabilization) were not fundamentally different than those of native macrophytes. We identified three invasive traits largely responsible for negative effects on fish and macroinvertebrate communities: increased growth rate, allelopathic chemical production, and phenotypic plasticity allowing for greater adaptation to environmental conditions than native species. We suggest that information on invasive macrophytes (including invasive traits) along with environmental data could be used to create models to better predict impacts of macrophyte invasion. However, effects of invasive macrophytes on trophic dynamics are less well-known and more research is essential to define system level processes.},

abstract = {Many of the world's most vulnerable and rapidly changing ecosystems are also among the most data-poor, leading to an increased interest in use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to document long-term environmental change. The integration of multiple knowledge sources for assessing species abundance and distribution has gained traction over the past decade as a growing number of case studies show concordance between LEK and scientific data. This study advances the use of quantitative approaches for synthesizing LEK by presenting a novel application of bootstrapping and statistical modeling to evaluate variance in ecological observations of fisheries practitioners. We developed an historical record of abundance for 22 marine species in Puget Sound, Washington (USA), using LEK, and we quantified variation in perceptions of abundance trends among fishers, divers, and researchers. These individuals differed in aspects of their information environments, which are characterized by how, when, and where an individual has acquired ecological information. Abundance trends derived from interviews suggest that populations of long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have been in decline since at least the 1960s and that three rockfishes protected under the Endangered Species Act were perceived as relatively less abundant than other species. Differences in perception of rockfish abundance trends among age groups were consistent with our hypothesis that the reported magnitude of decline in abundance would increase with age, with younger respondents more likely to report high abundance than older individuals across all periods. Temporal patterns in the mean and variance of reported rockfish abundance indices were qualitatively similar between fishers and researchers; however, fishers reported higher indices of abundance than researchers for all but one rockfish species. The two respondent groups reported similar changes in rockfish abundance from the 1940s to 2000s, except for two recreationally valuable species that fishers perceived as having undergone greater declines than perceived by researchers. When aggregated at appropriate spatial-temporal scales and in a culturally appropriate manner, observations of resource users are a valuable source of ecological information. Continued development of creative analytical tools for synthesizing multiple knowledge sources will be essential for advancing the formal use of LEK in assessments of marine species. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {We used data from 162 lakes in northern Wisconsin during 1990–1999 to develop a stock–recruitment model for walleye Stizostedion vitreum and to identify important factors affecting recruitment. We used the linear version of the Ricker stock–recruit model and regression tree analysis to model age-0 walleye density, which ranged from 0.24 to 505 per km of shoreline (mean  51.2). Adult walleye density ranged from .040 to 5.9 per surface hectare (mean  1.5). The density of adult (sexually mature) walleyes, calendar year, and angling harvest rate of yellow perch Perca flavescens were significant descriptors of age-0 walleye density. Adult walleye density explained 10% of the variation in age-0 walleye abundance, which exhibited significant compen- satory density dependence. Calendar year and yellow perch density explained nearly 32% of the residual variation in age-0 walleye density. The average age-0 walleye density in high-recruitment years (1991, 1994, and 1995) was 74.2/km, whereas the average age-0 walleye density in low- recruitment years (1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996–1999) was 38.5/km. Yellow perch harvest rates influenced walleye recruitment in low-recruitment years, as lakes with angler harvest rates of yellow perch lower than 0.79/h had lower recruitment of age-0 walleyes; in high-recruitment years, by contrast, yellow perch density did not affect recruitment.

abstract = {We develop a mechanistically motivated von Bertalanffy growth model to estimate growth rate and its predictors from spatial–temporal data and compare this model's performance with a suite of commonly used mixed-effects growth models. We test these models with simulated data and then apply them to test whether concerns that high density is causing growth suppression of walleye (Sander vitreus) in Alberta, Canada, are supported using data collected during 2000–2017. Simulation experiments demonstrated that models that failed to account for complex dependency structures often resulted in growth rate estimates that were less accurate and biased low as judged by median absolute relative error and median relative error, respectively. The magnitude of this bias depended on the parameter values used for simulation. For the case study, a spatial– temporal model was more parsimonious and had higher predictive performance relative to simpler models and did not support the slow-growing walleye hypothesis in Alberta. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering spatial–temporal correlation in analyses that rely on surveillance-style monitoring datasets, particularly when examining relationships between life-history traits and environmental characteristics.},

Using a comprehensive global database, we quantified the effect of fluctuations in food abundance on seabird breeding success. We identified a threshold in prey (fish and krill, termed "forage fish") abundance below which seabirds experience consistently reduced and more variable productivity. This response was common to all seven ecosystems and 14 bird species examined within the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. The threshold approximated one-third of the maximum prey biomass observed in long-term studies.

abstract = {Introduction: The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that indigenous people have a fundamental right to contribute to the management of the resources that support their livelihoods. Salmon are vital to the economy and culture of First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. In this region, traditional systems of management including weirs–fences built across rivers to selectively harvest salmon–supported sustainable fisheries for millennia. In the late-19th century traditional fishing practices were banned as colonial governments consolidated control over salmon. Outcomes: In collaboration with the Heiltsuk First Nation we revived the practice of weir building in the Koeye River. Over the first four years of the project we tagged 1,226 sockeye, and counted 8,036 fish during fall stream walks. We used a mark-recapture model which accounted for both pre-spawn mortality due to variation in temperature, and tag loss, to produce the first mark-resight estimates of sockeye abundance in the watershed (4,600–15,000 escapement). Discussion: High river temperatures are associated with increased en route morality in migrating adult sockeye. We estimated pre-spawn mortality ranged from 8–72% across the four years of study, highlighting the degree to which climate conditions may dictate future viability in sockeye salmon populations. These results demonstrate the power of fusing traditional knowledge and management systems with contemporary scientific approaches in developing local monitoring.},

abstract = {Indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure may be integrated with marine and social science to conserve the bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon Islands. Three aspects of indigenous ecological knowledge in Roviana were identified as most relevant for the management and conservation of bumphead parrotfish, and studied through a combination of marine science and anthropological methods. These were (1) local claims that fishing pressure has had a significant impact on bumphead parrotfish populations in the Roviana Lagoon; (2) the claim that only small bumphead parrotfish were ever seen or captured in the inner lagoon and that very small fish were restricted to specific shallow innerlagoon nursery regions; and (3) assertions made by local divers that bumphead parrotfish predominantly aggregated at night around the new moon period and that catches were highest at that time. The research supported claims (1) and (2), but did not support proposition (3). Although the people of the Roviana Lagoon had similar conceptions about their entitlement rights to sea space, there were marked differences among regional villages in their opinions regarding governance and actual operational rules of management in the Lagoon. Contemporary differences in management strategies resulted from people's historical and spatial patterns of settlement across the landscape and adjoining seascapes, and the attendant impact of these patterns on property relations. This was crucial in distinguishing between those villages that held secure tenure over their contiguous sea estates from those that did not. Indigenous ecological knowledge served to (1) verify that the bumphead parrotfish was a species in urgent need of protection; (2) explain how different habitats structured the size distribution of bumphead parrotfish; (3) identify sensitive locations and habitats in need of protection; and (4) explain the effect of lunar periodicity on bumphead parrotfish behaviour and catch rates. Secure customary sea tenure identified locations best suited to bumphead parrotfish management programmes, with a greater likelihood for local participation and programme success. The information was used to establish two marine protected areas in the region for bumphead parrotfish conservation.},

abstract = {1. Rapid system-wide changes triggered by predators can pose considerable challenges to people. In the Northeast Pacific, the recovery of sea otters Enhydra lutris following their extirpation due to the 18th and 19th century fur trade is driving a social-ecological regime shift with profound implications. While the ecological consequences of this shift are well documented, very little research has examined the conditions that enable or constrain people's ability to adapt to the social, economic and cultural changes that transpire. 2. Through a collaborative partnership and workshops with Indigenous knowledge holders spanning Alaska to British Columbia, along with quantitative and qualitative interviews in two Indigenous communities among the first to experience sea otter recovery, we examined people's perceptions of the social-ecological conditions that affect their ability to adapt to these changes. 3. We found that communities differed in their relative rankings of adaptation-enabling conditions; however, the following four broad strategies were perceived as critical to improving coexistence with sea otters: (a) strengthening Indigenous gov-ernance and decision-making authority; (b) promoting adaptive co-management; (c) weaving Indigenous knowledge and Western science into management plans and (d) establishing learning platforms. Both communities also identified that increased livelihood options and financial assistance would not compensate for lost food security. 4. Differences in enabling conditions and attitudes towards sea otters within and between communities can be attributed to the social-ecological and political context in which sea otter recovery occurs. 5. Our study suggests that enhancing Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to predator induced regime shifts will require a transformation in current resource},

We characterize the optimal way to distribute harvesting effort over space and time in order to optimize returns from this spatial/dynamic system. We also investigate how the optimal spatial allocation of effort, harvesting, and biomass compare with second-best allocations that ignore spatial processes in this system. We find that optimal instruments reflect the interplay between the spatial gradient of rents and the spatial gradient of biological dispersal. Using a simple parameterization to explore qualitative properties in several specific examples, we find that second-best solutions blend or average results of the differentiated case and differ in intuitive ways from first-best optima. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Kelp forests are among the most abundant coastal marine habitats but are vulnerable to climate change. The Northeast Pacific has experienced recent large-scale changes in kelp abundance and distribution, but little is known about changes north of the British Columbia (BC)–Washington border. Here, we assessed whether and how floating canopy kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera, Nereocystis luetkeana) distributions have changed in recent decades along the extensive coast of BC. We assembled and analysed available kelp distributional data, comparing snapshots of kelp linear extent from 1.5–3 decades ago (1994–2007) to recently collected data (2017–2021) across 11 different subregions spanning the province. We then leveraged timeseries, where available (n = 7 data sets), to contextualise patterns of change. In aggregate, the data suggest that kelp forests have declined considerably in some parts of the province, but with variable patterns of change across BC. In the warmest areas (southern BC), kelp persistence was negatively correlated with mean summer sea surface temperatures, which at times exceeded known thermal tolerances. In contrast, in northern subregions, top-down control by sea urchins and otters appeared to modulate kelp dynamics, with declines occurring in 2 subregions despite cool ocean temperatures. Timeseries data suggest that many declines occurred around the 2014–2016 marine heatwave, an event associated with sustained warming and altered trophic dynamics. Our results suggest that the extent of BC's kelp forests has declined in some places in recent decades, but that regional and local-scale factors influence their responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {Adaptive management of marine protected areas (MPAs) to determine whether they are meeting their intended goals requires predicting how soon those goals will be realized. Such predictions have been made for increases in fish abundance and biomass inside MPAs. However, projecting increases in fishery yield (“fishery spillover”) is more complex because it involves both how the fishery is managed and uncertainty in larval connectivity. We developed a two-patch, age-structured population model, based on a renewal equation approach, to project the initial timing of increase in fishery yield from larvae exported from a no-take MPA. Our results link our understanding of the predicted timing of increases in biomass (and thus reproduction) in MPAs with the time-lags associated with new recruits entering the fishery. We show that the time-lag between biomass peaking within the MPA and the increased fishery yield outside the MPA reaching its maximum depends, in a predictable way, on the age-dependent patterns of growth, natural mortality, and fishing mortality. We apply this analysis to 16 fishery species from the US Pacific coast; this difference ranged from 7 to 18 years. This model provides broadly applicable guidance for this important emerging aspect of fisheries management.},

abstract = {1. Spatial heterogeneity in population density is predicted to have important effects on population characteristics, such as competition intensity and carrying capacity. Patchy breeding distributions will tend to increase spatial heterogeneity in population density, whereas dispersal from breeding patches will tend to decrease it. The potential for dispersal to homogenize densities is likely to differ both among organisms (e.g. plants vs. mobile animals) and throughout ontogeny (e.g. larvae vs. adults). However, for mobile organisms, experimental studies of the importance of breeding distributions from the wild are largely lacking. 2. In the present study, experimental manipulations replicated over eight natural streams and 2 years enabled us to test for effects of the distribution of Atlantic salmon eggs over spatial scales which are relevant to local interactions among individuals. Artificial nests were placed along 250 m study reaches at one of two levels of nest dispersion - patchy (two nests per stream) and dispersed (10 nests per stream) - while holding total egg density (eggs m(-2) stream area) constant. 3. Nest dispersion had significant effects on the spatial distribution of the resulting juveniles in their first summer. Patchy nest distributions resulted in a highly right-skewed frequency distribution of local under-yearling densities (among 25 m sampling sections), as sample sections adjacent to the nest sites had relatively high densities. In contrast, dispersed nest distributions yielded approximately normal density distributions. Sections with high relative densities in the patchy nest distribution treatments also had relatively small juvenile body sizes, and patchy egg distribution appeared to produce a higher redistribution of individuals from the first to the second juvenile growth season than the dispersed distribution. 4. Because patchy breeding distribution combined with limited early dispersal can create spatial variation in density over scales directly relevant for individual interactions, this will be one important component in determining mean levels of early juvenile competition and its spatial variation within populations. Assuming random or ideal-free distribution of individuals may therefore underestimate the mean level of density experienced by juveniles over surprisingly small spatial scales (orders of magnitude smaller than total spatial extent of populations), even for mobile organisms.},

abstract = {Pacific salmon are a dominant component of the northeast Pacific ecosystem. Their status is of concern because salmon abundance is highly variable - including protected stocks, a recently closed fishery, and actively managed fisheries that provide substantial ecosystem services. Variable ocean conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), have influenced these fisheries, while diminished diversity of freshwater habitats have increased variability via the portfolio effect. We address the question of how recent changes in ocean conditions will affect populations of two salmon species. Since the 1980s, El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have been more frequently associated with central tropical Pacific warming (CPW) rather than the canonical eastern Pacific warming ENSO (EPW). CPW is linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), whereas EPW is linked to the PDO, different indicators of northeast Pacific Ocean ecosystem productivity. Here we show that both coho and Chinook salmon survival rates along western North America indicate that the NPGO, rather than the PDO, explains salmon survival since the 1980s. The observed increase in NPGO variance in recent decades was accompanied by an increase in coherence of local survival rates of these two species, increasing salmon variability via the portfolio effect. Such increases in coherence among salmon stocks are usually attributed to controllable freshwater influences such as hatcheries and habitat degradation, but the unknown mechanism underlying the ocean climate effect identified here is not directly subject to management actions.},

The best way to estimate the minimum sizes of reserves may be a three-step process: (1) identify target or keystone species whose disappearance would significantly decrease the value or species diversity of the reserve; (2) determine the minimum number of individuals in a population needed to guarantee a high probability of survival for these species; (3) using known densities, estimate the area needed to sustain the minimum number. The forces that affect population viability and determine MVPs (minimum viable populations) are extremely complex. Thoughtful estimates of MVPs for many animal species are rarely lower than an effective size of a few hundred. Attempts to save only common or smaller species in a community will usually be ill-fated because of the web of ecological relationships between species, including the importance of predation and herbivory in the maintenance of species diversity. Other topics discussed include the complementarity of conservation goals, the problematic function of corridors and the value of buffer zones. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {An emerging perspective in the study of density dependence is the importance of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of resources. Although this is well understood in temperate ungulates, few studies have been conducted in tropical environments where both food and water are limiting resources. We studied the regulation of one of the world's largest elephant populations in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. The study period started in 1986 when the population was released from culling. Using census data we investigated changes in elephant abundance with respect to rainfall and density across the entire park and across waterholes. The population more than doubled since culling stopped. The population increased continuously during the first 6 years, and then fluctuated widely at about 30 000 individuals. Immigration processes must have been involved in the increase of the population size. Population growth rates were negatively related to previous population density by a convex relationship, and negatively related to the ratio of previous population density on annual rainfall by a linear relationship. However, only this latter model (i.e. assuming a fluctuating carrying capacity related to annual rainfall) produced realistic dynamics. Overall, population decreased during dry years when the elephant density was high. During dry years there were fewer waterholes retaining water during the dry season and consequently elephant numbers at waterholes increased, while their aggregation level across waterholes decreased. On the long-run elephant numbers increased only at the less crowded waterholes. We suggest that the interaction between population size and the available foraging range determined by the number of active waterholes during the dry season controls the park population. Our results emphasize the need to understand how key-resource areas cause resource-based aggregation, which ultimately influences the strength of density dependence. More specifically, this study suggests that climate variability strongly affects local elephant population dynamics through changes in surface-water availability. Finally, as dispersal is likely to be an important driver of the dynamics of this population, our results support views that a metapopulation framework should be endorsed for elephant management in open contexts.},

For three small estuaries in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, changes in eelgrass area coverage and shape index (over the period of 1932-2016) were assessed using historical aerial photographs and unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery. In addition, changes in eelgrass area and shape index were evaluated in relation to landscape-level coastal environmental indicators, namely shoreline activities and alterations and residential housing density. All three eelgrass meadows showed a deteriorating trend in eelgrass condition; on average, eelgrass area coverage decreased by 45.1%, while meadow complexity as indicated by the shape index increased by 66.3%. Shoreline activities (boats, docks, log booms, and armoring) and residential housing density increased markedly at all sites over the study period and were strongly correlated to eelgrass area coverage and shape index. Changes in these landscape-level indicators over this period corroborate the observed decline in eelgrass habitat condition, because they suggest an overall deterioration of coastal environmental health in the Salish Sea due to increased use of the coastal zone, as well as declines in water quality due to urbanization.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of early marine entry timing and body size on the marine (smolt-to-adult) survival of Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We used data from coded wire tag release groups of hatchery Chinook salmon to test whether hatchery release date, release size, and size in offshore waters in July and September influenced marine survival. Marine survival was most strongly related to the average body size in July, with larger sizes associated with higher survivals. This relationship was consistent over multiple years (1997-2002), suggesting that mortality after July is strongly size-dependent. Release size and date only slightly improved this relationship, whereas size in Sep-tember showed little relationship to marine survival. Specifically, fish that experienced the highest marine survivals were released before 25 May and were larger than 17 g (or 120 mm fork length) by July. Our findings highlight the importance of local conditions in Puget Sound (Washington, USA) during the spring and summer, and suggest that declines in marine survival since the 1980s may have been caused by reductions in the quality of feeding and growing conditions during early marine life.

Many of these long-lived SESs have adapted their institu- tions to the particular pattern of variability they have experienced over time as well as to the broader economic, political, and social system in which they are located. Such adaptations alter resource use patterns in time and=or space to maintain the configuration of the SESs. Even well-adapted SESs, however, can become vulner- able to new types of disturbances. Through the analysis of a series of case studies, we begin to characterize different types of adaptations to particular types of varia- bility and explore vulnerabilities that may emerge as a result of this adaptive pro- cess.

abstract = {The North Sea provides a useful model for considering forage fish (FF) within ecosystem-based management as it has a complex assemblage of FF species. This paper is designed to encourage further debate and dialogue between stakeholders about management objectives. Changing the management of fisheries on FF will have economic consequences for all fleets in the North Sea. The predators that are vulnerable to the depletion of FF are Sandwich terns, great skua and common guillemots, and to a lesser extent, marine mammals. Comparative evaluations of management strategies are required to consider whether maintaining the reserves of prey biomass or a more integral approach of monitoring mortality rates across the trophic system is more robust under the ecosystem approach. In terms of trophic energy transfer, stability, and resilience of the ecosystem, FF should be considered as both a sized-based pool of biomass and as species components of the system by managers and modellers. Policy developers should not consider the knowledge base robust enough to embark on major projects of ecosystem engineering. Management plans appear able to maintain sustainable exploitation in the short term. Changes in the productivity of FF populations are inevitable so management should remain responsive and adaptive. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Therefore, we quantified regional fishery profiles of the average number of complete-trip interviews, effort per acre, the number of walleyes Sander vitreus harvested per angler-hour, and the number of walleyes harvested per acre among hours, seasons, and years from 1991 to 2002 in northern Wisconsin lakes. The average number of interviews within days was similar between weekday and weekend day types but differed between open-water and ice-fishing seasons, peaking at midday and late afternoon during open water and midday during ice fishing. The average harvest rate within days was similar between day types and seasons and was highest in the morning and afternoon. The average angler effort during the angling season differed between day types and peaked in July on weekdays and in May on weekends. The average harvest rate during the angling season differed between day types and peaked in May on weekdays but also December on weekends. The average harvest per acre during the angling season was similar between day types and declined from May to February. The cumulative average angler effort was higher on weekdays than on weekends during 1991-2002, but the harvest rate and harvest per acre were similar between day types. Angler effort, harvest rate, and harvest per acre did not change significantly among years. Angler use and success changed systematically within days and among seasons but not among years, which suggests that walleye populations and the associated fishery were stable. The regional fishery profiles for each estimate were similar to the results from smaller-scale studies, suggesting that regional profiles can accurately depict patterns on a smaller scale. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2007.},

abstract = {Recreation demand models frequently are used to explain outdoor recreation behavior and to estimate willingness to pay for changes in environmental quality at recreation sites. Among the most commonly used recreation demand models are site choice models based on the multinomial logit framework, which account for the spatial relationships between each recreator's home and multiple alternative destinations thereby capturing the substitution possibilities among recreation sites. However, standard applications of this framework typically do not account for the possibility of spatial connections among the sites via movements of the target species, such as fish in connected water bodies in recreational angling applications or terrestrial species in hunting or wildlife viewing applications. In this paper we examine aspects of environmental valuation and natural resource dynamics that generally are addressed separately. Specifically, we show that in such spatially connected systems, a "reduced form" application of the standard site choice modeling approach, using proxy measures of environmental quality rather than direct measures of species abundances, can produce biased estimates of willingness to pay for environmental improvements. Furthermore, we show that under some conditions poorly targeted environmental improvements in spatially connected systems can lead to welfare decreases. In such systems a structural model of recreator site choices and species sorting behavior and population dynamics may be required to fully account for the spatial linkages among sites and the feedback effects between recreators and the target species. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Landscape ecology deals with the effects of the spatial configuration of mosaics on a wide variety of ecological phenomena. Because problems in many areas of conserva- tion biology and resource management are related to landscape use, development of a rigorous theoretical and empirical foundation for landscape ecology is essential. We present an approach to research that focuses on how individual-level mechanisms operating in a heterogeneous mosaic produce ecological patterns that are spatially dependent. The theoretical framework that we develop considers the density and distribution of a population among patches as a function of (a) within-patch move- ment patterns of individuals; (b) emigration from patches as a function of population density, patch configuration, patch context, and within-patch movement; and (c) loss of individuals as they disperse through landscape elements. This theoretical frame- work is coupled with an empirical approach that emphasizes the use of experimental model systems (EMS), small-scale systems occupying "microlandscapes." Such sys- tems are amenable to experimental manipulation with adequate replication and control and may serve as analogs of systems occurring at broader landscape scales, where rigorous empirical work is more difficult. We illustrate the use of EMS with examples from our studies of beetles and ants in North America and of voles in Norway. Finally, we consider some factors that may constrain extrapolations from EMS to other systems, scales, or levels. We believe that implementation of a mecha- nistic approach to landscape ecology is essential to deriving generalizations about how spatial heterogeneity influences ecological systems.},

abstract = {<p>In this report, we synthesize the overarching principles and general guidelines that underpin the establishment of marine protected area (MPA) networks designed to meet ecological, governance, social and cultural objectives, based on the peer-reviewed literature. These guidelines are supported by scientific research, institutional experience and global case studies, and take a social-ecological systems approach to marine conservation. Information reviewed in this report suggests that the design of MPAs and MPA networks require the simultaneous consideration of ecological features and processes, governance arrangements, economic costs and benefits, as well as social and cultural values. Planners, managers and decision-makers can use the guidelines synthesized in this report to support the process of MPA network design in their local contexts. We discuss how several of the design guidelines apply to the Pacific region of British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, given the federal and provincial governments have committed to establishing a bioregional network of MPAs.In this report we reviewed and synthesized:› Ecological principles and guidelines for MPA network design, with discussion and recommendations on how each of these principles could be applied in B.C.;› Species-specific movement and larval duration estimates for a selection of marine species of ecological, economic, cultural and conservation importance in B.C., with recommendations on how this can inform guidelines on the size and spacing of MPA networks in B.C.;› Overarching principles from global literature on good governance of MPAs and MPA networks;› Design goals and strategies for achieving different social objectives in MPA and MPA network planning; and› Opportunities and challenges for integrating local knowledge systems (focus on Traditional Ecological Knowledge) into marine planning and MPA design.Lastly, we assessed relevant B.C. policy documents using the ecological and good governance guideline frame- works.According to our synthesis of the literature, successful establishment and effective management of MPA networks depend on legitimate and effective governance arrangements that can accommodate ecological criteria while considering the perspectives and input of local resource users and stakeholders. Furthermore, policy makers should specify MPA objectives as this will guide design priorities, assessment and monitoring, and ensure that trade-o s are transparent.Overall, the principles and guidelines synthesized in this report support an approach to MPA design that incorporates biodiversity and ecosystem resilience objectives while recognizing human uses and values. Our compendium of information is most relevant to MPA planning processes in B.C., but can be applied and adapted to MPA and MPA network design in any other region.</p>},

abstract = {We explore the relationship between network structure and dynamics by relating the topology of spatial networks with its underlying metapopulation abundance. Metapopulation abundance is largely affected by the architecture of the spatial network, although this effect depends on demographic parameters here represented by the extinction-to-colonization ratio (e/. c). Thus, for moderate to large e/. c-values, regional abundance grows with the heterogeneity of the network, with uniform or random networks having the lowest regional abundances, and scale-free networks having the largest abundance. However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities, with heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node's incidence (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its degree, and with the average degree of the nodes it interacts with. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial network structure to understanding metapopulation abundance, and serve to determine under what circumstances information on network structure should be complemented with information on the species life-history traits to understand persistence in heterogeneous environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fisheries managers often assess fish populations using catch per unit effort (CPUE), size and age structure, growth, and condition. For many freshwater fishes and common sampling gears, CPUE, size and age structure, and condition are highest in the spring and fall, while growth commonly is fastest during the summer growing season. However, there are exceptions to these general trends, especially in populations with erratic recruitment, growth, or mortality. At the least, CPUE, size and age structure, growth, and condition of fish should be expected to change with season, given the effects of variable recruitment, growth, and mortality. However, if recruitment, growth, and mortality are relatively stable, seasonal changes in sampling data occur due to changes in fish behavior caused by many factors (e.g., changes in temperature, turbidity, food availability, photoperiod, etc.). However, these patterns of change through the seasons should not necessarily be assumed to be the same for all fish species or for species in all habitats or geographic r$\sim$gions. Thus, managers and researchers need to consider the seasonal patterns in sampling pata for a particular species within a certain habitat in their geographic region when collecting standardized data sets, and when assessing populations and communities.},

abstract = {Short-term bursts of prey availability occur in many ecosystems and have potential important consequences for both predator biology and ecosystem function. Examples of prey 'pulses' in marine ecosystems include spawning runs of several anadromous and marine fishes, horseshoe crab spawning, and salmonid juvenile outmigrations, which are exploited by numerous species of vertebrate predators. In a few cases, the fitness or demographic consequences of such predator-prey interactions are known or inferred, but too often that information remains unknown. We explored the extent of temporal and spatial variation in one example of a pulsed marine resource: the spawning of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). Spawning herring provide a rich, aggregated resource to which dozens of species of vertebrate predators often exhibit strong numerical responses. However, the spawning events are often variable in both time (annual differences of several to many weeks) and space (both regional and more local differences in size and timing of events). Such variability must affect more mobile predators less than area-restricted predators, and thus its effect would vary not only among species but also within species, depending on constraints of the predator life history. Unpredictability of the prey concentrations, whatever their proximate causes, may contribute to maintenance of metapopulations of prey such as herring, if unpredictability lessens the impact of predation. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

abstract = {Use of extensive but low-resolution abundance data is common in the assessment of species at-risk status based on quantitative decline criteria under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and national endangered species legislation. Such data can be problematic for 3 reasons. First, statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no change is often low because of small sample size and high sampling uncertainty leading to a high frequency of type II errors. Second, range-wide assessments composed of multiple site-specific observations do not effectively weight site-specific trends into global trends. Third, uncertainty in site-specific temporal trends and relative abundance are not propagated at the appropriate spatial scale. A common result is the propensity to underestimate the magnitude of declines and therefore fail to identify the appropriate at-risk status for a species. We used 3 statistical approaches, from simple to more complex, to estimate temporal decline rates for a designatable unit (DU) of rainbow trout in the Athabasca River watershed in western Canada. This DU is considered a native species for purposes of listing because of its genetic composition characterized as >0.95 indigenous origin in the face of continuing introgressive hybridization with introduced populations in the watershed. Analysis of abundance trends from 57 time series with a fixed-effects model identified 33 sites with negative trends, but only 2 were statistically significant. By contrast, a hierarchical linear mixed model weighted by site-specific abundance provided a DU-wide decline estimate of 16.4% per year and a 3-generation decline of 93.2%. A hierarchical Bayesian mixed model yielded a similar 3-generation decline trend of 91.3% and the posterior distribution showed that the estimate had a >99% probability of exceeding thresholds for an endangered listing. We conclude that the Bayesian approach was the most useful because it provided a probabilistic statement of threshold exceedance in support of an at-risk status recommendation.},

However, few studies explore temperature as a mechanism driving ecological responses to fragmentation. Here we offer a conceptual framework that integrates thermal biology into fragmentation research to better understand individual, species, community, and ecosystem-level responses to fragmentation. Specifically, the framework addresses how fragmentation changes temperature and how the effects of those temperature changes spread through the ecosystem, from organism response via thermal sensitivity, to changes in species distribution and activity patterns, to shifts in community structure following species' responses, and ultimately to changes in ecosystem functions. We place a strong emphasis on future research directions by outlining "Critical gaps" for each step of the framework. Empirical efforts to apply and test this framework promise new understanding of fragmentation's ecological consequences and new strategies for conservation in an increasingly fragmented and warmer world.},

A 70 year (1951–2020) time series analysis of temperature, salinity, and oxygen in four such fjords between ∼54 and 50oN (Douglas Channel, Rivers Inlet, Knight Inlet and Bute Inlet) shows that changes were greatest in deep waters between the sill and the bottom. In Rivers, Knight and Bute Inlet, the deep water temperature increased by 1.2–1.3°C over 70 years, up to two times the global average for open ocean waters at corresponding depths, while salinity increased by 0.1–0.2, and oxygen decreased by 0.4–0.7 mLL−1. The most northern inlet, Douglas Channel, showed a temperature increase of 0.8°C from 1951 to 2016, while trends in oxygen and salinity were not statistically significant. An analysis of Apparent Oxygen Utilization suggests that the deep waters in Douglas Channel are more readily exchanged with the outer coast than the three other fjords.},

abstract = {Parametric and nonparametric kernel methods dominate studies of animal home ranges and space use. Most existing methods are unable to incorporate information about the underlying physical environment, leading to poor performance in excluding areas that are not used. Using radio-telemetry data from sea otters, we developed and evaluated a new algorithm for estimating home ranges (hereafter Permissible Home Range Estimation, or "PHRE") that reflects habitat suitability. We began by transforming sighting locations into relevant landscape features (for sea otters, coastal position and distance from shore). Then, we generated a bivariate kernel probability density function in landscape space and back-transformed this to geographic space in order to define a permissible home range. Compared to two commonly used home range estimation methods, kernel densities and local convex hulls, PHRE better excluded unused areas and required a smaller sample size. Our PHRE method is applicable to species whose ranges are restricted by complex physical boundaries or environmental gradients and will improve understanding of habitat-use requirements and, ultimately, aid in conservation efforts.},

We have estimated the historic biomass of salmon returning to the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California) to be 160-226 million kg. The number of fish now returning to these rivers has a biomass of 11.8-13.7 million kg. These numbers indicate that just 6-7% of the marine-derived nitrogen and phosphorous once delivered to the rivers of the Pacific Northwest is current-ly reaching those streams. This nutrient deficit may be one indication of ecosystem failure that has contributed to the downward spiral of salmonid abundance and diversity in general, further diminishing the possibility of salmon population recovery to self-sustaining levels.},

abstract = {Variability in animal growth from one population to another is of keen interest to population ecologists wishing to understand the inherent within species variability and explore meaningful environmental covariates. Yet most studies investigating growth of animals within a population are usually analyzed in isolation from, or at best, compared qualitatively across populations. Here, we introduce statistical methods that permit simultaneous quantitative analysis of the growth of 245 populations of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) across the North American Continent. Growth in length at age is modeled using a nonlinear mixed effect model and we used Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis as a natural approach to estimate parameters, investigate growth variability among populations and to elucidate meaningful biological covariates for this species. Growth of M. salmoides across North America varied by more than 120% in terms of maximum attainable size (L∞; 36-80 cm) and by more than 88% in terms of instantaneous growth rates (K; 0.091 to 0.670 per year). Results from this method also confirm the theoretical, but often untested, view that growth parameters L∞ and K are negatively correlated in fish populations; Bayesian credibility intervals ranged from -0.56 to -0.72 with the posterior mode of -0.65. The Bayesian hierarchical growth model showed less variability in growth parameters and lower correlations among parameters than those from standard techniques used in population ecology suggesting that the absolute value of the correlation between L∞ and K may be lower than the general perception in the ecological literature, often in the range of -0.8 to -0.9. Finally, growth parameters were negatively correlated with latitude suggesting that population productivity most likely declines the higher in latitude a population is found for this species.},

We compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that 45% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type. Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.},

abstract = {Great Bear Lake is the most northerly lake of its size and provides unique opportunities for intraspecific diversification. Despite increasing attention to intraspecific polymorphism, several knowledge gaps remain (e.g. determining the extent of intraspecific diversification in large relatively pristine lakes and at which spatial scale it can occur). We focused on geographical patterns of morphological differentiation within lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to describe two levels of intralake diversification in Great Bear Lake. We used a combination of geometric and traditional linear measurements to quantify differences in body shape, head shape, and fin and body lengths among 910 adult lake trout from the five distinct arms of Great Bear Lake. Although head and fin linear measurements discriminated the three common morphotypes at the whole-lake level, inter-arm variation in body shape was observed within each morphotype. A comparison of genetic and morphological distance matrices revealed the lack of an association between the two sets of data, although both comparisons revealed an association in the inter-arm variation patterns among morphotypes, suggesting a phenotypically plastic response to distinct environments. The whole-lake and inter-arm morphological variation observed within lake trout demonstrates the importance of considering scale, especially across large lakes that exhibit marked complexity and a variety of freshwater habitats. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 114, 109–125.},

abstract = {Forage fish—small, low trophic level, pelagic fish such as herrings, sardines, and anchovies—are important prey species in marine ecosystems and also support large commercial fisheries. In many parts of the world, forage fish fisheries are managed using precautionary principles that target catch limits below the maximum sustainable yield. However, there are increasing calls to further limit forage fish catch to safeguard their fish, seabird, and marine mammal predators. The effectiveness of these extra-precautionary regulations, which assume that increasing prey abundance increases predator productivity, are under debate. In this study, we used prey-linked population models to measure the influence of forage fish abundance on the population growth rates of 45 marine predator populations representing 32 fish, seabird, and mammal species from 5 regions around the world. We used simulated data to confirm the ability of the statistical model to accurately detect prey influences under varying levels of influence strength and process variability. Our results indicate that predator productivity was rarely influenced by the abundance of their forage fish prey. Only 6 predator populations (13% of the total) were positively influenced by increasing prey abundance and the model exhibited high power to detect prey influences when they existed. These results suggest that additional limitation of forage fish harvest to levels well below sustainable yields would rarely result in detectable increases in marine predator populations.},

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. The presence/absence of a species at a particular site is the simplest form of data that can be collected during ecological field studies. We used 13 years (1990-2002) of survey data to parameterize a stochastic patch occupancy model for a metapopulation of the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, and investigated the significance of particular patches and the influence of site quality, network characteristics and regional stochasticity on the metapopulation persistence. 2. Persistence of the yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation was strongly dependent on the high quality colony sites, and persistence probability was highly sensitive to small changes in the quality of these sites. 3. A relatively small number of colony sites was ultimately responsible for the regional persistence. However, lower quality satellite sites also made a significant contribution to long-term metapopulation persistence, especially when regional stochasticity was high. 4. The northern network of the marmot metapopulation was more stable compared to the southern network, and the persistence of the southern network depended heavily on the northern network. 5. Although complex models of metapopulation dynamics may provide a more accurate description of metapopulation dynamics, such models are data-intensive. Our study, one of the very few applications of stochastic patch occupancy models to a mammalian species, suggests that stochastic patch occupancy models can provide important insights into metapopulation dynamics using data that are easy to collect.},

abstract = {Oil and gas interests and the government recently offered a First Nation in the Skeena River estuary (BC, Canada) $1 billion to consent to construction of a controversial terminal to load fossil fuels onto tankers ([ 1 ][1]). The proposal highlights a troubling blind spot in Canada's environmental decisionmaking. This gap could enable decisions that insufficiently consider risks to both environment and people. Science can help decrease these blind spots. The second-largest salmon producer in Canada, the Skeena River has supported First Nation fisheries for 5 millennia ([ 2 ][2]). Its estuary is a nursery for hundreds of millions of young salmon annually as they graduate from freshwater to sea ([ 2 ][2]). It is also situated between fossil fuel reserves in interior Canada and ocean-access to Asian markets. Multinational companies have proposed pipelines to and terminals in the estuary, and are currently assessing the environmental impacts on constitutionally protected ([ 3 ][3]) aboriginal fisheries. Previous research indicates that industrialized estuaries depress salmon survival ([ 4 ][4]). Although terminal proponents and the government have recognized interests of First Nations from the estuary during environmental assessment, they have ignored interests of upriver First Nations who also harvest salmon ([ 5 ][5]). Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers during their life. We have shown that the proposed development area supports particularly high abundances of juvenile salmon from more than 40 populations that are harvested in at least 10 First Nations territories throughout the Skeena watershed and beyond ([ 6 ][6], [ 7 ][7]). This is twice the number of First Nations groups that industry proponents identified as needing to be consulted ([ 5 ][5]). These data reveal a striking mismatch between the narrow consideration of aboriginal rights and environmental risks and the true scale of environmental connections, which needs to be addressed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and industrial proponents. The terminal application is being evaluated by CEAA without consideration of upriver First Nations ([ 5 ][5]). Moreover, despite the resounding rejection of the $1 billion by the estuary First Nation due to environmental and cultural concerns, the government has ratified fiscal agreements with terminal proponents ([ 8 ][8]). The Skeena Watershed is united by salmon; First Nations throughout the watershed should be involved in decisio{\ldots}},

We evaluated the contribution and relative abundance of advanced-size (65–90 mm total length [TL]) hatchery Florida largemouth bass M. salmoides floridanus that were stocked into Lake Talquin (3,561 ha) to supplement year-classes. Stocking density varied from 15 to 60 fish/ha from 2000 to 2003. Coded wire tags and unique nuclei in the sagittal otoliths of hatchery fish were used to identify stocked fish to estimate percent contribution and relative abundance. Hatchery fish released by May 15 used threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense as a primary food source at significantly higher (P , 0.05) frequencies than did wild age-0 Florida largemouth bass examined from June to October. Dominant modal size-groups (20–27 cm TL) of age-0 hatchery fish in October electrofishing were larger than those of age-0 wild fish (10–14 cm TL). Hatchery fish made up an estimated 17–40% of the age-0 fish collected during October electrofishing from 2000 to 2003. The highest stocking density (60 fish/ha) resulted in a 40% hatchery contribution to electrofishing samples at age 0 and a 37% contribution to electrofishing samples at age 3. For the group stocked at the highest density, electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) at age 0 (26 fish/h) and age 3 (8 fish/h) was higher (P,0.05) than that for groups stocked at lower densities (15–39 fish/ha; age-0 CPUE¼7– 17 fish/h; age-3 CPUE¼2 fish/h). Hatchery fish contribution to largemouth bass angler tournament catch in April–May 2004–2006 was estimated to be at least 20% after 4 years of variable stocking. Several factors, such as appropriate time of stocking, size at stocking, food supply, and age-0 wild and stocked fish densities, influenced hatchery fish contributions to each year-class and the fishery.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a 'best' management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current 'best practice' guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

abstract = {In response to a climate regime shift in 1977 and general heating of the North Pacific Ocean, pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha abundance reached record highs during 2005−2021, comprising 70% of all Pacific salmon. Pink salmon are approximately 25 times more numerous in odd- than even-numbered calendar years in some major North Pacific ecosystems, a unique demographic pattern analogous to repeating whole ecosystem treatment−control experiments. We found compelling examples indicating that in odd years, predation by pink salmon can initiate pelagic trophic cascades by reducing herbivorous zooplankton abundance sufficiently that phytoplankton densities increase, with opposite patterns in even years. Widespread interspecific competition for common-pool prey resources can be dominated by pink salmon, as indicated by numerous biennial patterns in the diet, growth, survival, abundance, age-at-maturation, distribution, and/or phenology of ecologically, culturally, and economically important forage fishes, squid, Pacific salmon and steelhead trout Oncorhynchus spp., seabirds, humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, and endangered southern resident killer whales Orcinus orca. In aggregate, the evidence indicates that open-ocean marine carrying capacity in the northern North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea can be mediated by top-down forcing by pink salmon and by ocean heating, and that large-scale hatchery production ($\sim$40% of the total adult and immature salmon biomass) likely has unintended consequences for wild salmon, including Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, and many other marine species. Further investigation of the effects of pink salmon on other species will increase our knowledge of ecosystem function and the important role top-down forcing plays in the open ocean},

abstract = {Abstract In many parts of the world, policymakers, legislators, marine managers, and indigenous peoples have attempted to reconcile marine protected area (MPA) governance and management with indigenous peoples' ancient and ongoing traditional ownership of coastal and marine environments. This paper describes a novel approach in Australia to addressing this challenge through indigenous-led planning and collaborative governance of holistic coastal land and sea indigenous protected areas (IPAs) based on the indigenous concept of ?Country??traditional land and sea estates and their associated cultural, environmental, and other values. To provide context to this approach, the paper explains the concept of ?Sea Country? and provides an overview of the relationship between indigenous peoples and Australia's coastal and marine environments, the legal and policy recognition of Indigenous Sea Country rights and interests, and the engagement of indigenous people in the governance and management of government-led, legislated MPAs in Australia. The paper then describes the evolution of IPAs from being specifically based on indigenous land tenure to being based more generally on Indigenous Country, across multiple tenures, including marine areas. In recent years, IPAs based on Country have enabled indigenous people to lead planning and governance of land and sea areas over which they have limited legal rights, including over existing national parks and marine parks. Using this approach, some IPAs complement existing protected area governance and management arrangements, whereas elsewhere Country-based IPAs are adding significantly to Australia's MPA estate. The Dhimurru IPA in the Northern Territory and Girringun Region IPAs in Queensland are presented as examples of this Country-based approach. This indigenous-driven, collaborative, nonlegislative approach to dedicating, governing and managing coastal areas and MPAs may serve as a model in other nation states for indigenous people wishing to use a protected area governance framework to support the contemporary management of their traditional marine and coastal estates.},

It addresses the problem of resource model identification, that is, the question: Which of various competing models correctly describes the resource? A major theme of the paper is the proposition that data uncertainty and model ambiguity are fundamentally intertwined. In some cases this relationship can be proved rigorously; consequently, model ambiguity can be inevitable. In other cases, promising identification techniques are suggested by modern statistical theory, and the paper examines some of these in the context of time series analysis.

abstract = {Salmonids are an important component of biodiversity, culture and economy in several regions, particularly the North Pacific Rim. Given this importance, they have been intensively studied for about a century, and the pioneering scientists recognized the critical link between population structure and conservation. Spatial structure is indeed of prime importance for salmon conservation and management. At first glance, the essence of the metapopulation concept, i.e. a population of populations, widely used on other organisms like butterflies, seems to be particularly relevant to salmon, and more generally to anadromous fish. Nevertheless, the concept is rarely used, and barely tested.  Here, we present a metapopulation perspective for anadromous fish, assessing in terms of processes rather than of patterns the set of necessary conditions for metapopulation dynamics to exist. Salmon, and particularly sockeye salmon in Alaska, are used as an illustrative case study. A review of life history traits indicates that the three basic conditions are likely to be fulfilled by anadromous salmon: (i) the spawning habitat is discrete and populations are spatially separated by unsuitable habitat; (ii) some asynchrony is present in the dynamics of more or less distant populations and (iii) dispersal links populations because some salmon stray from their natal population. The implications of some peculiarities of salmon life history traits, unusual in classical metapopulations, are also discussed.  Deeper understanding of the population structure of anadromous fish will be advanced by future studies on specific topics: (i) criteria must be defined for the delineation of suitable habitats that are based on features of the biotope and not on the presence of fish; (ii) the collection of long-term data and the development of improved methods to determine age structure are essential for correctly estimating levels of asynchrony between populations and (iii) several key aspects of dispersal are still poorly understood and need to be examined in detail: the spatial and temporal scales of dispersal movements, the origin and destination populations instead of simple straying rates, and the relative reproductive success of immigrants and residents. },

abstract = {Quantitative genetic theory assumes that trade-offs are best represented by bivariate normal distributions. This theory predicts that selection will shift the trade-off function itself and not just move the mean trait values along a fixed trade-off line, as is generally assumed in optimality models. As a consequence, quantitative genetic theory predicts that the trade-off function will vary among populations in which at least one of the component traits itself varies. This prediction is tested using the trade-off between call duration and flight capability, as indexed by the mass of the dorsolateral flight muscles, in the macropterous morph of the sand cricket. We use four different populations of crickets that vary in the proportion of macropterous males (Lab = 33%, Florida = 29%, Bermuda = 72%, South Carolina = 80%). We find, as predicted, that there is significant variation in the intercept of the trade-off function but not the slope, supporting the hypothesis that trade-off functions are better represented as bivariate normal distributions rather than single lines. We also test the prediction from a quantitative genetical model of the evolution of wing dimorphism that the mean call duration of macropterous males will increase with the percentage of macropterous males in the population. This prediction is also supported. Finally, we estimate the probability of a macropterous male attracting a female, P, as a function of the relative time spent calling (P = time spent calling by macropterous male/(total time spent calling by both micropterous and macropterous male). We find that in the Lab and Florida populations the probability of a female selecting the macropterous male is equal to P, indicating that preference is due simply to relative call duration. But in the Bermuda and South Carolina populations the probability of a female selecting a macropterous male is less than P, indicating a preference for the micropterous male even after differences in call duration are accounted for.},

abstract = {Synopsis This essay reviews the behavioral responses of fish to reduced levels of dissolved oxygen from the perspective of optimization theory as used in contemporary behavioral ecology. A consideration of oxygen as a resource suggests that net oxygen gain per unit of energy expenditure will be the most useful currency for ecological models of breathing. In the process of oxygen uptake, fish always expend energy on perfusion, usually on ventilation and often on locomotion. These costs, and the risk of predation, will vary with oxygen availability and the type of behavioral response shown. The principal categories of behavioral response to reduced external availability of dissolved oxygen are (1) changes in activity, (2) increased use of air breathing, (3) increased use of aquatic surface respiration, and (4) vertical or horizontal habitat changes. Fish should choose whichever combination of responses minimizes the costs of meeting their oxygen demands. A small number of studies provides qualitative support for this prediction.},

abstract = {Periods of summertime low flows are often critical for fish. This study quantified the impacts of forest clear-cutting on summertime low flows and fish habitat and how they evolved through time in two snowmelt-dominant headwater catchments in the southern interior of British Columbia, Canada. A paired-catchment analysis was applied to July–September water yield, the number of days each year with flow less than 10% of mean annual discharge, and daily streamflow for each calendar day. The postharvest time series were divided into treatment periods of approximately 6–10 years, which were analysed independently to evaluate how the effects of forestry changed through time. An instream flow assessment using a physical habitat simulation-style approach was used to relate streamflow to the availability of physical habitat for resident rainbow trout. About two decades after the onset of logging and as the extent of logging increased to approximately 50% of the catchments, reductions in daily summertime low flows became more significant for the July–September yield (43%) and for the analysis by calendar day (11–68%). Reductions in summertime low flows were most pronounced in the catchment with the longest postharvest time series. On the basis of the temporal patterns of response, we hypothesize that the delayed reductions in late-summer flow represent the combined effects of a persistent advance in snowmelt timing in combination with at least a partial recovery of transpiration and interception loss from the regenerating forests. These results indicate that asymptotic hydrological recovery as time progresses following logging is not suitable for understanding the impacts of forest harvesting on summertime low flows. Additionally, these reductions in streamflow corresponded to persistent decreases in modelled fish habitat availability that typically ranged from 20% to 50% during the summer low-flow period in one of the catchments, suggesting that forest harvest may have substantial delayed effects on rearing salmonids in headwater streams.},

Royle) in three major embayments of Lake Seminole, Georgia. Relative weight, fecundity, and growth of large-mouth bass in the Spring Creek embayment (76% areal SAV coverage) was considerably less than measured in the Chattahoochee and Flint river arms that contained lower SAV coverages (26% and 32%). It took fish 1.8 years longer to reach 406 mm in Spring Creek compared to the Chattahoochee-Flint arms. Consequently, fish were smaller in Spring Creek than in the Chattahoochee-Flint arms. In addition, due to slower growth rates and lower fecundity-to-body weight relation, we predicted a 47% reduction in total potential ova production in Spring Creek compared to the other two reservoir embayments. The annual survival rate of 3 to 10 year old largemouth bass was higher in Spring Creek (84%) than in the Chattahoochee-Flint arms (72%) and suggested either lower harvest and/or lower accessibility of particularly larger fish to angling in dense vegetation. Contrary to our expectaions, the fit between number-at-age and age in a catch-curve regression was weaker for fish collected in Spring Creek and suggested greater recruitment variability has occurred over time in this highly vegetated embayment. In Lake Seminole, spatial differences in largemouth bass population characterstics were associated with disparate levels of SAV. Our data suggest that a reduction in hydrilla, but maintenance of an intermediate level of SAV in Spring Creek, should improve largermouth bass population in this arm of the reservoir.},

abstract = {To evaluate trap success among camera types and across species as well as assess habitat selection by target carnivore species, we established 16 infrared- triggered camera stations across a 26.9-km2 study area located on primarily Jefferson National Forest land in Virginia. We monitored camera stations for 72 days (August to October 2005) for a total of 891 trap nights (TN) of effort. Overall trap success for all animals combined was 40.74 captures per 100 TN. Procyon lotor (raccoon) had the highest predator trap success (2.81/100 TN), followed by: Ursus americanus (black bear, 1.91/100 TN); Lynx rufus (bobcat, 1.46/100 TN); Canis latrans (coyote, 1.01/100 TN); and Urocyon cinereoargenteus (gray fox, 0.56/100 TN). Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) had the highest overall trap success (21.32/100 TN), followed by Sciurus carolinensis (gray squirrel, 6.17/100 TN). Passive camera units, especially DeerCam, had higher trap success than active camera units, and digital camera units (Reconyx) out-performed fi lm cameras. We extracted percent cover of habitat features coniferous, % deciduous, % water, % agricultural) from a geographic information system (GIS) using circular buffers around each trap site and compared carnivore-present sites to carnivore-absent sites. We compared carni- vore trap success to the distance to the main access road and to trap success of prey species, primarily deer and gray squirrel. We also compared each carnivores trap success to that of the other carnivore species to determine if carnivore presence or activity levels infl uenced other carnivores. Black bear, coyote, and raccoon tended to avoid areas with a high percentage of coniferous forest, and only bobcat showed sig- nifi cant avoidance of coniferous forest. Bobcat trap success increased with distance to the main road, and coyote trap success was positively (but weakly) related to gray squirrel trap success. Human foot traffi c did not affect carnivore trap success. This study elucidates differences among camera trap systems, and highlights the potential to monitor carnivore species simultaneously and in combination with a GIS to predict occurrence across a landscape.

abstract = {The prevalence of widespread, human-caused ecological degradation suggests that fundamental change is needed in how societies interact with the environment. In this paper we argue that durable models of environmental relationships already exist in approaches of place-based peoples, whose values connect people to their environments, provide guidance on appropriate behaviors, and structure sustained people-place relationships. To illustrate, we identify and discuss concordant values of indigenous peoples at opposite ends of the Pacific Ocean: the Māori of Aotearoa (New Zealand), and First Nations of the West Coast of Canada. We find that values of relatedness to, respect of, and reciprocity with other species and places correspond with sustained long-term relationships between people and places, and illustrate with examples from both regions. We propose that by integrating a values-led foundation into management broadly, values-led management could enable similar sustained relationships in places where they have been recently disrupted or where they are altogether lacking. We characterize values-led management as being founded on values that underpin stewardship-like relationships between people and place and that in turn guide related objectives, policies, and practices. We examine two contemporary values-led management plans that follow this structure, and provide additional examples of emergent values-led approaches elsewhere. From these we compile a set of questions that might guide the conception of place-based values-led management in decolonizing contexts, in contexts where people have a desire for place-based approaches but have not yet distilled foundational values for guidance, or in contexts where people have a united set of values but have not yet translated them into specific management approaches. We conclude by discussing both the challenges and learning opportunities that the resumption, or commencement, of values-led management might entail.},

We compared abundances of small mammals (voles, mice, and shrews) during four summers among partially harvested mixed coniferous–deciduous stands (52–59% basal area removal, 15m2/ha live-tree residual basal area), regenerating commercial clearcuts (11–20-year-old), mature (>12m tree height) mixed stands, mature deciduous, and mature coniferous stands. Partially harvested stands had significantly greater overall abundance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) than mature mixed stands, but abundances of red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) and short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were not significantly different. Regenerating clearcut stands had significantly lower abundances of voles and mice relative to mature mixed stands, and ranked low in abundance of shrews. Mature coniferous stands also ranked low in relative abundance of shrews and had the lowest abundance of deer mice relative to other mature stand types. Mature deciduous stands ranked high in abundance of deer mice and had the greatest abundance of short-tailed shrews among all stand types. Despite reduced canopy closure, lower relative density of coniferous trees and saplings, and decreased basal area of deciduous trees and snags, partially harvested stands supported densities of mice and voles comparable to mature mixed-forest types. Forest harvesting practices that retain some structural attributes of mature forests may be beneficial to small mammals and associated predators that utilize mice, voles, and shrews as prey.},

abstract = {Metapopulation stability is a critical ecological property. Although ecosystem size has been considered as a fundamental driver of metapopulation stability, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may not be appropriate for complex branching ecosystems, such as rivers. Here, we show that a scale-independent characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations. We theoretically revealed that a strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect of branching complexity was consistently observed in metapopulations of four ecologically distinct riverine fishes. Hence, branching complexity may be a ubiquitous agent of metapopulation stability in branching ecosystems. The loss of such complexity may undermine resilience of metapopulations.Intraspecific population diversity (specifically, spatial asynchrony of population dynamics) is an essential component of metapopulation stability and persistence in nature. In 2D systems, theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size (or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics. However, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may be inadequate to predict emergent properties of branching ecosystems, an overlooked but widespread habitat geometry. Here, we combine theory and analyses of a unique long-term dataset to show that a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations. In riverine systems, each branch (i.e., tributary) exhibits distinctive ecological dynamics, and confluences serve as “merging” points of those branches. Hence, increased levels of branching complexity should confer a greater likelihood of integrating asynchronous dynamics over the landscape. We theoretically revealed that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes in natural conditions, where within-branch synchrony exceeds among-branch synchrony. Contrary to current theories developed in 2D systems, metapopulation size (a variable closely related to ecosystem size) had vague effects on metapopulation stability. These theoretical predictions were supported by 18-y observations of fish populations across 31 watersheds: Our cross-watershed comparisons revealed consistent stabilizing effects of branching complexity on metapopulations of very different riverine fishes. A strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is likely to be a pervasive feature of branching networks that strongly affects species persistence during rapid environmental changes.},

abstract = {Invasions by exotic species represent both threats to ecosystems as well as opportunities to learn more about them. Among the invaders that will have the largest impacts are those that directly modify ecosystems and thus have cascading effects resident for biota. Exotics can affect ecosystems by altering system-level flows, availability, or quality of nutrients, food, and physical resources (e.g. living space, water, heat or light). The invader-mediated control of physical resources, typically achieved through the modifi- cation of habitats, has received limited attention in invasion biology. This reflects a general trend in ecology, and only recently has the concept of ecosystem engineering been developed to account for the role of species that shape habitats. Plants and animals in terrestrial and aquatic systems can both create and destroy structure. When introduced into ecosystems, these exotic engineers cause physical state changes with effects that ramify throughout the system. Although the consequences of these modifications are varied and complex, insight gained from general ecological principles offers an opportunity to predict what invaders will do upon their integration into systems. Examples from the literature suggest that introduced ecosystem engineers that increase habitat complexity or heterogeneity tend to cause abundances and/or species richness to rise, while those that decrease complexity tend to have the reverse effect. In assessing such patterns, however, it is critical to also consider spatial scales and the life habits of resident organisms. In addition to providing predictive power, recognition of engineering as a major means by which invasive species affect ecosystems provides a unifying theme for invasion biology and offers a chance to consider more fully the general role of species in ecosystem},

Simulation testing across four life histories is used to compare the RE approach with standard nonlinear (SNL) approaches that use the primary, average, or median ages in growth estimation. Sensitivity tests compare the effects of assumed length and ageing error, selectivity, and recruitment variability on the estimation of growth curve parameters. Results support the use of the RE method using a gamma distribution over the SNL methods because RE method estimates of VBGF growth parameters were more precise across life histories and sensitivity trials. This general approach can be applied and expanded to other growth models. Applications demonstrate that the results from RE methods may differ in biologically important ways to those obtained from SNL approaches.},

abstract = {Population regulation is fundamental to the long-term persistence of populations and their responses to harvesting, habitat modification, and exposure to toxic chemicals. In fish and other organisms with complex life histories, regulation may involve density dependence in different life-stages and vital rates. We studied density dependence in body growth and mortality through the life-cycle of laboratory populations of zebrafish Danio rerio. When feed input was held constant at population-level (leading to resource limitation), body growth was strongly density-dependent in the late juvenile and adult phases of the life-cycle. Density dependence in mortality was strong during the early juvenile phase but declined thereafter and virtually ceased prior to maturation. Provision of feed in proportion to individual requirements (easing resource limitation) removed density dependence in growth and substantially reduced density dependence in mortality, thus indicating that 'bottom-up' effects act on growth as well as mortality, but most strongly on growth. Both growth and mortality played an important role in population regulation, with density-dependent growth having the greater impact on population biomass while mortality had the greatest impact on numbers. We demonstrate a clear ontogenic pattern of change in density-dependent processes within populations of a very small (maximum length 5 mm) fish, maintained in constant homogeneous laboratory conditions. The patterns are consistent with those distilled from studies on wild fish populations, indicating the presence of broad ontogenic patterns in density-dependent processes that are invariant to maximum body size and hold in homogeneous laboratory, as well as complex natural environments.},

The latter theory largely replaced the former one in the 1980s, especially in conservation applications. It is only recently that ecologists have fully realized that a relatively simple general theory can be readily constructed that makes some of the simplifying assumptions of the two earlier theories unnecessary. The spatially realistic metapopulation theory thereby provides a more unified framework for spatial ecology than the island theory or the classical metapopulation theory. This article describes the application of the spatially realistic metapopulation theory to real metapopulations living in highly fragmented landscapes. I discuss the principal messages for population ecology and conservation biology, and I also place this theory into a broader context of other approaches to spatial ecology.},

Theory predicts that elevated growth rates in domestic salmonids will result in greater risk-taking to access abundant food, but low survival in the presence of predators. In replicated whole-lake experiments, we observed that domestic trout (selected for high growth rates) took greater risks while foraging and grew faster than a wild strain. However, survival consequences for greater growth rates depended upon the predation environment. Domestic trout experienced greater survival when risk was low, but lower survival when risk was high. This suggests that animals with high intrinsic growth rates are selected against in populations with abundant predators, explaining the absence of such phenotypes in nature. This is, to our knowledge, the first large-scale field experiment to directly test this theory and simultaneously quantify the initial invasibility of domestic salmonid strains that escape into the wild from aquaculture operations, and the ecological conditions affecting their survival.},

abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest ("derived quantities") are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional "plug-in" estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new "epsilon" estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

abstract = {Estuarine seagrass ecosystems provide important habitat for fish and invertebrates and changes in these systems may alter their ability to support fish. The response of fish assemblages to alteration of eelgrass (Zostera marina) ecosystems in two ecoregions of the Mid-Atlantic Bight (Buzzards Bay and Chesapeake Bay) was evaluated by sampling historical eelgrass sites that currently span a broad range of stress and habitat quality. In two widely separated ecoregions with very different fish faunas, degradation and loss of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat has lead to declines in fish standing stock and species richness. The abundance, biomass, and species richness of the fish assemblage were significantly higher at sites that have high levels of eelgrass habitat complexity (biomass ? 100 wet g m?2 ; density ? 100 shoots m?2) compared to sites that have reduced eelgrass (biomass ? 100 wet g m?2 ; density ? 100 shoots m?2 ) or that have completely lost eelgrass. Abundance, biomass, and species richness at reduced eelgrass complexity sites also were more variable than at high eelgrass complexity habitats. Low SAV complexity sites had higher proportions of pelagic species that are not dependent on benthic habitat structure for feeding or refuge. Most species had greater abundance and were found more frequently at sites that have eelgrass. The replacement of SAV habitats by benthic macroalgae, which occurred in Buzzards Bay but not Chesapeake Bay, did not provide an equivalent habitat to seagrass. Nutrient enrichment-related degradation of eelgrass habitat has diminished the overall capacity of estuaries to support fish pop- ulations},

abstract = {Whirling disease of rainbow trout is caused by Myxobolus cerebralis, a myxozoan parasite possessing a life cycle well adapted to the natural environments where salmonid fish are found. Whirling disease was first described in Europe in 1898 among farmed rainbow trout but recent occurrences have been devastating to wild trout in North America. The disease is considered a major threat to survival of wild rainbow trout in the intermountain west of the United States. Difficulties in containing the spread and potentially eliminating the pathogen are tied to features of a complex life cycle involving two hosts, the salmonid fish and an aquatic oligochaete. Details of the morphologic development of the parasite have been described in each host but only now are we beginning to appreciate the breadth of interactions between these developmental forms and the sequential responses of the host. Fundamental mechanisms of the recognition and attachment of the parasite to the hosts, how host immunity is evaded and the unknown influences of environmental factors all contribute to a rather poor understanding of the biology of the parasite. Although the biology and ecology of the salmonid host are better known than for the oligochaete host, our knowledge is inadequate to interpret their complex interactions with the parasite. This uncertainty precludes the development of effective management activities designed to enhance the viability and productivity of wild trout populations in M. cerebralis-positive river systems. Improving our understanding of the hosts, the parasite and the environmental factors determining their interaction should provide for more focused and effective control methods for containing the spread and devastating effects whirling disease is causing to our wild trout populations.},

Some territories were preferred while others were avoided. On return from migra- tion, males and females settled earlier on high-occupancy territories. 3. The positive association between territory occupancy and breeding performance held in all years of study at Lake Lugano, and in six of seven tested populations. As a result, high-occupancy territories contributed most of the young produced by each population. 4. The occupation rate of the overall 225 territories was related positively to food avail- ability and negatively to mortality risk, measured as proximity to the nearest eagle owl Bubo bubo Linnaeus nest. 5. At the population level, spatial variation in mean occupancy was positively cor- related with spatial variation in mean productivity, suggesting that mean occupancy could be used as a measure of overall habitat quality and population performance. 6. In the Lake Lugano area, a higher proportion of low quality territories was occupied in years of higher density and annual productivity was related negatively to its coeffi- cient of variation. However, annual productivity was not related significantly to the pro- portion of low quality territories occupied, so support for the theory of site-dependent population regulation was only partial. 7. In a review of 22 studies of territory occupancy in 17 species, occupancy always devi- ated from a random pattern in species in which it was tested and was always correlated with productivity and/or with some other measure of territory quality. Our results con- firm the importance of prioritizing conservation of high quality territories. Occupancy may be a reliable method of quality assessment, especially for populations in which not all territories are always occupied, or for species in which checking occupancy is easier than finding nests.},

abstract = {nclosure traps that quickly surround well-defined areas of habitat are perhaps the most widely used method for sampling fishes in vegetated habitats. However, relatively few data are available to evaluate the effects of habitat structure on sampling characteristics of enclosure traps. In this study, we determined how clearing efficiency and accuracy of l-m2 throw traps varied across a range of environmental conditions in the Florida Everglades by sampling within enclosed areas of marsh habitat. Throw trap clearing efficiency and sampling accuracy did not differ among two widely separated locations and appeared to be unaffected by variation in water depth, canopy height, plant cover, plant stem density, and periphyton volume. Sampling accuracy averaged 63% of fishes present after correcting for clearing efficiencies. On average, 83% of the fishes present in a throw trap were recovered. Therefore, it appeared that about 17% of the missing fishes may have burrowed into the substrate or been discarded with sorted detritus. In contrast, the remaining 20% of fishes probably avoided the throw trap. This is the first study to differentiate between potential sources of throw trap sampling errors. Importantly, density estimates obtained by throw traps were positively correlated (r = 0.82) with actual population densities. Mean fish lengths and fish size distributions obtained by throw trapping usually did not differ from actual mean lengths or fish size distributions. Finally, high concordance of fish species ranks indicated that throw traps accurately described fish community structure. Throw traps appeared to provide relatively accurate estimates of fish density, fish size, and community structure across a range of environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The ideal free distribution (IFD) theory is one of the most influential theories in evolutionary ecology. It predicts how animals ought to distribute themselves within a heterogeneous habitat in order to maximize lifetime fitness. We test the population level consequence of the IFD theory using 40-year worth data on pike (Esox lucius) living in a natural lake divided into two basins. We do so by employing empirically derived density-dependent survival, dispersal and fecundity functions in the estimation of basin-specific density-dependent fitness surfaces. The intersection of the fitness surfaces for the two basins is used for deriving expected spatial distributions of pike. Comparing the derived expected spatial distributions with 50 years data of the actual spatial distribution demonstrated that pike is ideal free distributed within the lake. In general, there was a net migration from the less productive north basin to the more productive south basin. However, a pike density-manipulation experiment imposing shifting pike density gradients between the two basins managed to switch the net migration direction and hence clearly demonstrated that the Windermere pike choose their habitat in an ideal free manner. Demonstration of ideal free habitat selection on an operational field scale like this has never been undertaken before.},

Here, we analyze a time series of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance and examine the hypothesis that spatial contraction can decrease compen- satory capacity. Over the last 20 years, steelhead in the Keogh River have declined by an order of magnitude because of a period of poor smolt-to-adult survival. Low abundance has been associated with more depressed production of out-migrating smolts than would be expected based on traditional models of compensatory dynamics. Patterns of juvenile density over time show changes in the spatial distribution of the population. We developed a spatially explicit population model to explore spatial structure and juvenile recruitment under varying marine survival. Results suggest that spatial contraction during a period of poor marine survival can strengthen density-dependent population regulation, reducing smolt production at the watershed scale. Our results highlight that spatial contraction can alter the fundamental density-dependent relationships that define population dynamics, recovery trajectories, and sustainable harvest levels of spatially structured populations},

abstract = {Theory suggests an important role for population density in shaping adaptive landscapes through density-dependent selection. Here, we identify five methodological approaches for studying such selection, review the existing empirical evidence for it, and ask whether current declines in abundance can be expected to trigger evolutionary responses in salmonid fishes. Across taxa we find substantial amounts of evidence for population density influencing the location of adaptive peaks for a range of traits, and, in the presence of frequency dependence, changing the shape of selection (stabilizing versus disruptive). For salmonids, biological and theoretical considerations suggest that the optimal value of a number of traits associated with juvenile competitive ability (e. g. egg size, timing of emergence from nests, dominance ability), may depend on population density. For adults, more direct experimental and comparative evidence suggest that secondary sexual traits can be subject to density-dependent selection. There is also evidence that density affects the frequency-dependent selection likely responsible for the expression of alternative male reproductive phenotypes in salmon. Less is known however about the role of density in maintaining genetic variation among juveniles. Further efforts are required to elucidate the indirect evolutionary effects of declining population abundances, both in salmonids and in other anthropogenically challenged organisms.},

Technicians then visually analyze the thousands of generated images for features of interest (e.g., angler counts and environmental conditions) and use those data to estimate angling effort. The problem is that the visual analysis step is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to validate. Consequently, we elicited the strategies and best practices technicians used when analyzing images and identified bottlenecks. We then designed software, called Timelapse to better support image analysis. In use for several years, Timelapse has proven a cost-effective method of estimating angling effort in British Columbia's small lakes fisheries; it significantly eases a technician's workflow and doubles the number of images one can process per hour.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere <350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (<5% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (<4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (<15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of <10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social-ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of "planetary boundaries" lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development.

abstract = {The concept of phenotypic trade-offs is a central element in evolutionary theory. In general, phenotypic models assume a fixed trade-off function, whereas quantitative genetic theory predicts that the trade-off function will change as a result of selection. For a linear trade-off function selection will readily change the intercept but will have to be relatively stronger to change the slope. We test these predictions by examining the trade-off between fecundity and flight capability, as measured by dorso-longitudinal muscle mass, in four different populations of the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. Three populations were recently derived from the wild, and the fourth had been in the laboratory for 19 years. We hypothesized that the laboratory population had most likely undergone more and different selection from the three wild populations and therefore should differ from these in respect to both slope and intercept. Because of geographic variation in selection, we predicted a general difference in intercept among the four populations. We further tested the hypothesis that this intercept will be correlated with proportion macropterous and that this relationship will itself vary with environmental conditions experienced during both the nymphal and adult period. Observed variation in the phenotypic trade-off was consistent with the predictions of the quantitative genetic model. These results point to the importance of modeling trade-offs as dynamic rather than static relationships. We discuss how phenotypic models can incorporate such variation. The phenotypic trade-off between fecundity and dorso-longitudinal muscle mass is determined in part by variation in body size, illustrating the necessity of considering trade-offs to be multi factorial rather than simply bivariate relationships.},

abstract = {The success of avian monitoring programs to effectively guide management decisions requires that studies be efficiently designed and data be properly analyzed. A complicating factor is that point count surveys often generate data with non-normal distributional properties. In this paper we review methods of dealing with deviations from normal assumptions, and we focus on the application of generalized linear models (GLMs). We also discuss problems associated with overdispersion (more variation than expected). In order to evaluate the statistical power of these models to detect differences in bird abundance, it is necessary for biologists to identify the effect size they believe is biologically significant in their system. We illustrate one solution to this challenge by discussing the design of a monitoring program intended to detect changes in bird abundance as a result of Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) reduction projects in central Oregon. We estimate biologically significant effect sizes by using GLMs to describe variation in bird abundance relative to natural variation in juniper cover. These analyses suggest that for species typically positively associated with juniper cover, a 60-80 percent decrease in abundance may be expected as a result of juniper reduction projects. With these estimates of expected effect size and preliminary data on bird abundance, we use computer simulations to investigate the power of GLMs. Our simulations demonstrate that when data are not overdispersed and sample sizes are relatively large, the statistical power of GLMs is approximated well by formulas that are currently available in the bird literature for other statistical techniques. When data are overdispersed, as may be the case with most point count data, power is reduced.},

abstract = {Individuals migrate to exploit heterogeneities between spatially separated environments to modulate growth, survival, or reproduction. We devised a bioenergetics model to investigate the evolution of migration distance and its dependence on individual states. Atlantic cod Gadus morhua ranges from sedentary populations to stocks that migrate several thousand kilometers annually. We focused on the Northeast Arctic cod stock, which migrates south to spawn. A linear relationship between migration distance and the expected survival of offspring was assumed, here understood as the prospects for future survival and development that a fertilized egg faces at a particular spawning location. Reasons for why it may increase southward include warmer water that increases development rates, and thereby survival, along the pelagic drift trajectory. In the model, ingested energy can either be allocated to growth or stored for migration and reproduction. When migrating, individuals forgo foraging opportunities and expend energy. Optimal energy allocation and migration strategies were found using state-dependent optimization, with body length, age, condition, and current food availability as individual states. For both a historical and contemporary fishing regime we modeled two behaviors: (1) homing cod returning to the same spawning site each year and (2) roaming cod with no such constraints. The model predicted distinct regions of locally high spawning stock biomass. Large individuals in good condition migrated farthest, and these also tended to mature later in life. The roaming cod spread farther south as they grew larger and older. Homing cod did not have this freedom, and spawning was generally concentrated along a narrower stretch of the coastline. Under contemporary fishing, individuals matured earlier at a smaller size, had shorter migrations, spawned over a contracted geographical range, and tended to be in poorer condition. The effects were most pronounced for the homing behavior.},

abstract = {Understanding mechanisms that support long-term persistence of populations and sustainability of productive fisheries is a priority in fisheries management. Complex spatial structure within populations is increasingly viewed as a result of a plastic behavioral response that can have consequences for the dynamics of a population. We incorporated spatial structure and environmental forcing into a population model to examine the consequences for population stability (coefficient of variation of spawning-stock biomass), resilience (time to recover from disturbance), and productivity (spawning-stock biomass). White perch (Morone americana) served as a model species that exhibits simultaneous occurrence of migratory and resident groups within a population. We evaluated the role that contingents (behavioral groups within populations that exhibit divergent life histories) play in mitigating population responses to unfavorable environmental conditions. We used age-structured models that incorporated contingent-specific vital rates to simulate population dynamics of white perch in a sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay, USA. The dynamics of the population were most sensitive to the proportion of individuals within each contingent and to a lesser degree to the level of correlation in recruitment between contingents in their responses to the environment. Increased representation of the dispersive contingent within populations resulted in increased productivity and resilience, but decreased stability. Empirical evidence from the Patuxent River white perch population was consistent with these findings. A high negative correlation in resident and dispersive contingent recruitment dynamics resulted in increased productivity and stability, with little effect on resilience. With high positive correlation between contingent recruitments, the model showed similar responses in population productivity and resilience, but decreased stability. Because contingent structure involves differing patterns of nursery habitat use, spatial management that conserves sets of habitats rather than the single most productive nursery habitat would be expected to contribute to long-term population stability.},

These projections are critically needed to develop strategies for resource management and the conservation of marine ecosystems. SDMs are a powerful and necessary tool; however, they are subject to many sources of uncertainty, both quantifiable and unquantifiable. To ensure that SDM projections are informative for management and conservation decisions, sources of uncertainty must be considered and properly addressed. Here we provide ten overarching guidelines that will aid researchers to identify, minimize, and account for uncertainty through the entire model development process, from the formation of a study question to the presentation of results. These guidelines focus on correlative models and were developed at an international workshop attended by over 50 researchers and practitioners. Although our guidelines are broadly applicable across biological realms, we provide particular focus to the challenges and uncertainties associated with projecting the impacts of climate change on marine species and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Effort sorting is a process in fisheries where fishers of various skill levels sort according to fish density so that the mean catchability of remaining fishers increases as stock size declines. The resulting hyperstability in catch rates masks declining density, sometimes until fish populations have effectively collapsed. Effort sorting as a potential mechanism leading to hyperstability has been known for a while, but the ability to detect it using existing fisheries data has been limited. We present a way to detect effort sorting in fisheries and evaluate it using published recreational fisheries data. Specifically, we propose that catchability among anglers is log-normally distributed, but the anglers remaining fishing on any particular lake will have catchabilities high enough to exceed a minimum acceptable catch rate given available stock size. It is then possible to discern between hypotheses about causes of hyperstability, namely effort sorting or range contraction. However, the fitted model cannot reliably be used to predict fish density from catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data, reiterating the importance of fishery-independent data, and serving as a warning against using CPUE as an index of density in management.},

abstract = {Winter mortality has been documented in a large number of freshwater fish populations, and a smaller, but increasing, number of marine and estuarine fishes. The impacted populations include a number of important North American and European resource species, yet the sources of winter mortality remain unidentified in most populations where it has been documented. Among the potential sources, thermal stress and starvation have received the most research attention. Other sources including predation and pathogens have significant impacts but have received insufficient attention to date. Designs of more recent laboratory experiments have reflected recognition of the potential for interactions among these co-occurring stressors. Geographic patterns in winter mortality are, in some cases, linked to latitudinal clines in winter severity and variability. However, for many freshwater species in particular, the effects of local community structure (predators and prey) may overwhelm latitudinal patterns. Marine (and estuarine) systems differ from freshwater systems in several aspects important to overwintering fishes, the most important being the lack of isolating barriers in the ocean. While open population boundaries allow fish to adopt migration strategies minimizing exposure to thermal stresses, they may retard rates of evolution to local environments. Geographic patterns in the occurrence and causes of winter mortality are ultimately determined by the interaction of regional and local factors. Winter mortality impacts population dynamics through episodic depressions in stock size and regulation of annual cohort strength. While the former tends to act in a density-independent manner, the latter can be density dependent, as most sources of mortality tend to select against the smallest members of the cohort and population. Most stock assessment and management regimes have yet to explicitly incorporate the variability in winter mortality. Potential management responses include postponement of cohort evaluation (to after first winter of life), harvest restrictions following mortality events and habitat enhancement. Future research should place more emphasis on the ecological aspects of winter mortality including the influences of food-web structure on starvation and predation. Beyond illuminating an understudied life-history phase, studies of overwintering ecology are integral to contemporary issues in fisheries ecology including ecosystem management, habitat evaluation, and impacts of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

We combined data from two methods of scat analysis (DNA metabarcoding and morphological prey ID) to quantify the species and life stages of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) consumed by harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Strait of Georgia, Canada, where juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon survival is poor. Harbour seals primarily consumed adult salmon of lesser conservation concern in the fall (August–November): chum (Oncorhynchus keta: 18.4%), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha: 12.6%), sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka: 7.4%), Chinook (7.1%), and coho (1.8%). However, the opposite species trend occurred during the spring when seals preferred juvenile salmon of greater conservation concern (April–July): coho (2.9%), Chinook (2.9%), sockeye (2.5%), pink (1.4%), and chum (0.8%)—percentages that can equate to many individuals consumed. Our data suggest that harbour seals select juveniles of salmon species that out-migrate at ages >1 year and provide evidence of a potential causal relationship between harbour seal predation and juvenile salmon survival trends.},

abstract = {Selective harvest of large individuals should alter natural adaptive landscapes and drive evolution toward reduced somatic growth and increased reproductive investment. However, few studies have simultaneously considered the relative importance of artificial and natural selection in driving trait changes in wild populations. Using 50 years of individual-based data on Windermere pike (Esox lucius), we show that trait changes tracked the adaptive peak, which moved in the direction imposed by the dominating selective force. Individual lifetime somatic growth decreased at the start of the time series because harvest selection was strong and natural selection was too weak to override the strength of harvest selection. However, natural selection favoring fast somatic growth strengthened across the time series in parallel with the increase in pike abundance and, presumably, cannibalism. Harvest selection was overridden by natural selection when the fishing effort dwindled, triggering a rapid increase in pike somatic growth. The two selective forces appear to have acted in concert during only one short period of prey collapse that favored slow-growing pike. Moreover, increased somatic growth occurred concurrently with a reduction in reproductive investment in young and small female pike, indicating a tradeoff between growth and reproduction. The age-specific amplitude of this change paralleled the age-specific strength of harvest pressure, suggesting that reduced investment was also a response to increased life expectancy. This is the first study to demonstrate that a consideration of both natural selection and artificial selection is needed to fully explain time-varying trait dynamics in harvested populations.},

abstract = {For most species, a changeable environment creates a situation in which recruitment varies considerably from one breeding season to the next. If adults survive well, an occasional favorable recruitment can sustain population numbers over long periods. In effect, the gains made in favorable periods are stored in the adult population. Storage is particularly important when the species is at low densities, because then the potential population growth rate is very high if a favorable period occurs. Our past work showed that the storage mechanism could lead to coexistence of two species in lottery competition for space, as long as generations overlapped and there was sufficient variation in recruitment (Chesson and Warner 1981). This was true even if one species had an average competitive advantage. The storage model also operates when more than two species are competing, when resources renew independently of population sizes, and when not all the resource is used. It also operates in simple Lotka-Volterra systems in which adults do not compete directly with juveniles. The field ecologist is faced with the more practical problem of determining whether the storage mechanism is operating in a particular system. Species with relatively long lives and high fecundities are most likely to enjoy the benefits of the storage effect. Environments that theoretically elicit these life history characteristics are relatively benign and permanent for established adults, but are such that births and/or juvenile survivorship vary widely. Trees and many marine organisms are examples of species with the proper life histories, and storage may be important in maintaining the high diversity of these communities. The storage mechanism is capable of independently maintaining species coexistence, and we provide some suggestions on how to distinguish qualitatively the operation of storage from alternative mechanisms. We expect, however, that storage will make some positive contribution toward species persistence in nearly all communities, and we give a method for estimating empirically how large that contribution is.},

abstract = {In response to fisheries declines and delayed population recoveries, many management agencies globally are integrating alternative strategies that incorporate precautionary and ecosystem considerations, increasingly focusing on climate variability and change. Here, we quantitatively evaluate how these themes have been incorporated into the science and management plans for Canada's fisheries by analyzing the content of 905 research and management documents published by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) for the Atlantic and Eastern Arctic regions. We found that the precautionary approach was mentioned much more frequently (44%) than climate change (11%) or ecosystem approaches to fisheries management (1%). Of research documents that mentioned climate change, 61% contained only a single reference to it, suggesting that it is not quantitatively evaluated in the science that informs the advisory and decision-making processes. Most references to climate change in the DFO research documents expressed high uncertainty of how climate change would impact the stock dynamics. We propose explanations for this and discuss approaches for increasing the incorporation of these themes into Canada's fishery management.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Observation or sampling error in population monitoring can cause serious degradation of the inferences, such as estimates of trend or risk, that ecologists and managers frequently seek to make with time-series observations of population abundances. We show that replicating the sampling process can considerably improve the information obtained from population monitoring. At each sampling time the sampling method would be repeated, either simultaneously or within a short time. In this study we examine the potential value of replicated sampling to population monitoring using a density-dependent population model. We modify an existing population time-series model, the Gompertz state-space model, to incorporate replicated sampling, and we develop maximum-likelihood and restricted maximum-likelihood estimates of model parameters. Depending on sampling protocols, replication may or may not entail substantial extra cost. Some sampling programs already have replicated samples, but the samples are aggregated or pooled into one estimate of population abundance; such practice of aggregating samples, according to our model, loses considerable information about model parameters. The gains from replicated sampling are realized in substantially improved statistical inferences about model parameters, especially inferences for sorting out the contributions of process noise and observation error to observed population variability.},

abstract = {Abstract
MSY principles for marine fisheries management reflect a focus on obtaining continued high catches to provide food and livelihoods for humanity, while not compromising ecosystems. However, maintaining healthy stocks to provide the maximum sustainable yield on a single-species basis does not ensure that broader ecosystem, economic, and social objectives are addressed. We investigate how the principles of a “pretty good yield” range of fishing mortalities assumed to provide \>95\% of the average yield for a single stock can be expanded to a pretty good multispecies yield (PGMY) space and further to pretty good multidimensional yield to accommodate situations where the yield from a stock affects the ecosystem, economic and social benefits, or sustainability. We demonstrate in a European example that PGMY is a practical concept. As PGMY provides a safe operating space for management that adheres to the principles of MSY, it allows the consideration of other aspects to be included in operational management advice in both data-rich and data-limited situations. PGMY furthermore provides a way to integrate advice across stocks, avoiding clearly infeasible management combinations, and thereby hopefully increasing confidence in scientific advice.},

abstract = {In a 1966 American Naturalist article, G. C. Williams initiated the study of reproductive effort (RE) with the prediction that longer-lived organisms ought to expend less in reproduction per unit of time. We can multiply RE, often measured in fractions of adult body mass committed to reproduction per unit time, by the average adult life span to get lifetime reproductive effort (LRE). Williams's hypothesis (across species, RE decreases as life span increases) can then be refined to read "LRE will be approximately constant for similar organisms." Here we show that LRE is a key component of fitness in nongrowing populations, and thus its value is central to understanding life-history evolution. We then develop metabolic life-history theory to predict that LRE ought to be approximately 1.4 across organisms despite extreme differences in production and growth rates. We estimate LRE for mammals and lizards that differ in growth and production by five- to tenfold. The distributions are approximately normal with means of 1.43 and 1.41 for lizards and mammals, respectively (95% confidence intervals: 1.3-1.5 and 1.2-1.6). Ultimately, therefore, a female can only produce a mass of offspring approximately equal to 1.4 times her own body mass during the course of her life.},

abstract = {To remain viable, populations must be resilient to both natural and human-caused environmental changes. We evaluated anthropogenic effects on spatial connections among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) (designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) in the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. For several anthropogenic-effects scenarios, we used graph theory to characterize the spatial relation among populations. We plotted variance in population size against connectivity among populations. In our scenarios, reduced habitat quality decreased the size of populations and hydropower dams on rivers led to the extirpation of several populations, both of which decreased connectivity. Operation of fish hatcheries increased connectivity among populations and led to patchy or panmictic populations. On the basis of our results, we believe recolonization of the upper Cowlitz River by fall and spring Chinook and winter steelhead would best restore metapopulation structure to near-historical conditions. Extant populations that would best conserve connectivity would be those inhabiting the Molalla (spring Chinook), lower Cowlitz, or Clackamas (fall Chinook) rivers and the south Santiam (winter steelhead) and north fork Lewis rivers (summer steelhead). Populations in these rivers were putative sources; however, they were not always the most abundant or centrally located populations. This result would not have been obvious if we had not considered relations among populations in a metapopulation context. Our results suggest that dispersal rate strongly controls interactions among the populations that comprise salmon metapopulations. Thus, monitoring efforts could lead to understanding of the true rates at which wild and hatchery fish disperse. Our application of graph theory allowed us to visualize how metapopulation structure might respond to human activity. The method could be easily extended to evaluations of anthropogenic effects on other stream-dwelling populations and communities and could help prioritize among competing conservation measures.},

abstract = {Natal homing is a hallmark of the life history of salmonid fishes, but the spatial scale of homing within local, naturally reproducing salmon populations is still poorly understood. Accurate homing (paired with restricted movement) should lead to the existence of fine-scale genetic structuring due to the spatial clustering of related individuals on spawning grounds. Thus, we explored the spatial resolution of natal homing using genetic associations among individual Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in an interconnected stream network. We also investigated the relationship between genetic patterns and two factors hypothesized to influence natal homing and localized movements at finer scales in this species, localized patterns in the distribution of spawning gravels and sex. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that spawning locations in both sub-basins of our study site were spatially clumped, but the upper sub-basin generally had a larger spatial extent and continuity of redd locations than the lower sub-basin, where the distribution of redds and associated habitat conditions were more patchy. Male genotypes were not autocorrelated at any spatial scale in either sub-basin. Female genotypes showed significant spatial autocorrelation and genetic patterns for females varied in the direction predicted between the two sub-basins, with much stronger autocorrelation in the sub-basin with less continuity in spawning gravels. The patterns observed here support predictions about differential constraints and breeding tactics between the two sexes and the potential for fine-scale habitat structure to influence the precision of natal homing and localized movements of individual Chinook salmon on their breeding grounds.},

abstract = {Marine reserves (no-take zones) are widely recommended asconservation and fishery management tools. One potential benefitof marine reserves is that they can reduce fishing mortality.This can lead to increases in the abundance of spawners,providing insurance against recruitment failure and maintainingor enhancing yields in fished areas. This paper considers thefactors that influence recovery following marine reserveprotection, describes patterns of recovery in numbers andbiomass, and suggests how recovery rates can be predicted.Population recovery is determined by initial population size, theintrinsic rate of population increase r, and the degree ofcompensation (increases in recruits per spawner as spawnerabundance falls) or depensation (lower than expected recruitmentat low abundance, Allee effect) in the spawner-recruitrelationship. Within a reserve, theoretical recovery rates arefurther modified by metapopulation structure and the success ofindividual recruitment events. Recovery also depends on theextent of reductions in fishing mortality (F) as determined bythe relationship between patterns of movement, migration, anddensity-dependent habitat use (buffer effect) in relation to thesize, shape and location of the reserve. The effects ofreductions in F on population abundance have been calculatedusing a variety of models that incorporate transfer rates betweenthe reserve and fished areas, fishing mortality outside thereserve and life history parameters of the population. Thesemodels give useful indications of increases in production andbiomass (as yield per recruit and spawners per recruitrespectively) due to protection, but do not address recruitment.Many reserves are very small in relation to the geographicalrange of fish or invertebrate populations. In these reserves itmay be impossible to distinguish recovery due to populationgrowth from that due to redistribution. Mean rates of recoverycan be predicted from r, but the methods are data intensive. Thisis ironic when marine reserves are often favoured for managementor conservation in data-poor situations where conventional stockassessment is impossible. In these data-poor situations, it maybe possible to predict recovery rates from very low populationsizes by using maximum body size or age at maturity as simplecorrelates of the intrinsic rate of natural increase.},

abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social-ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components - latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy - most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.

abstract = {Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven. Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

abstract = {Fisheries science uses quantitative methods to inform management decisions that reflect cultural preferences which, in turn, indirectly influence the states of ecosystems. To date, it has largely supported Eurocentric preferences for the commodification of marine organisms under the tenets of maximum sustainable yield, whereby abundances are intentionally maintained far below their historical baselines despite broader socio-ecological trade-offs. In contrast, Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) adhere to the principle of “take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem,” implementing lower fishery removals to support socio-ecological resilience. Despite the power imbalance favouring Eurocentric preferences in decision-making, fisheries scientists increasingly recognize that the pairing of IKS and Western science, or Two-Eyed Seeing, would lead to more holistic management goals. For recognition to transcend tokenism, meaningful collaborations and co-governance structures underlying knowledge co-production must carry through to legislated policy changes. Using recent co-governance developments for fisheries management and spatial protections involving federal, provincial and Indigenous governments in Pacific Canada, we illustrate how the precautionary approach, including reference points and harvest control rules broadly applied in international fisheries, could be revised to make collaborative fisheries management compatible with IKS and improve biodiversity and fisheries protections. Our recommendations may create socio-economic trade-offs at different timescales for commercial fishers. Pre-empting that challenge, we discuss IKS-compatible economic approaches for addressing shorter term costs arising from reduced exploitation rates. Although our case study derives from Pacific Canada, the insights provided here are broadly applicable elsewhere in the world.},

abstract = {Access, defined as the ability to use and benefit from available marine resources or areas of the ocean or coast, is important for the well-being and sustainability of coastal communities. In Canada, access to marine resources and ocean spaces is a significant issue for many coastal and Indigenous communities due to intensifying activity and competition in the marine environment. The general trend of loss of access has implications for these communities, and for Canadian society. In this review and policy perspective, we argue that access for coastal and Indigenous communities should be a priority consideration in all policies and decision-making processes related to fisheries and the ocean in Canada. This paper reviews how access affects the well-being of coastal communities, factors that support or undermine access, and research priorities to inform policy. Recommended actions include: ensuring access is transparently considered in all ocean-related decisions; supporting research to fill knowledge gaps on access to enable effective responses; making data accessible and including communities in decision-making that grants or restricts access to adjacent marine resources and spaces; ensuring updated laws, policies and planning processes explicitly incorporate access considerations; and, identifying and prioritizing actions to maintain and increase access. Taking action now could reverse the current trend and ensure that coastal and Indigenous communities thrive in the future. This is not just a Canadian issue. Globally, the ability of coastal and Indigenous communities to access and benefit from the marine environment should be at the forefront in all deliberations related to the oceans.},

As the context of a model gradually extends beyond pure bioenergetics to include behaviour, life-history traits and function and performance of the entire organism, so does the need for complementing bioenergetic measurements with trade-offs, particularly those dealing with survival. Such a broadening of focus revitalized and expanded the domain of behavioural ecology in the 1980s. This review makes the case that a similar change of perspective is required for physiology to contribute to the types of predictions society currently demands, e.g. regarding climate change and other anthropogenic stressors.},

abstract = {Fish biodiversity sustains the resilience and productivity of fisheries, yet this biodiversity can be threatened by overharvest and depletion in mixed-stock fisheries. Thus, the biodiversity that provides benefits may also make sustainable resource extraction more difficult, a key challenge in fisheries management. We simulated a mixed-stock fishery to explore relationships between different dimensions of biodiversity and fishery performance relative to conservation and fishery objectives. Different dimensions of biodiversity (number of stocks, evenness, asynchrony among stocks, heterogeneity in stock productivity) exacerbated trade-offs between fishery and conservation objectives. For example, fisheries targeting stock-complexes with greater asynchrony, and to a lesser extent richness, had greater stability in harvest through time but also greater risks of overfishing weak stocks and reduced yield compared to less biodiverse stock-complexes. These trade-offs were ameliorated by increasing management control—the capacity of fishery managers to harvest specific stocks. To explore these trade-offs in real-world fisheries, we contrasted the fishing and population status of individual stocks within three major mixed-stock sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, Salmonidae) fisheries—Bristol Bay, Fraser River, and Skeena River. In general, the fisheries with lower management control had individual stocks that were more often being over- or under-fished, compared with those with higher management control, though variation among regions in biodiversity, scale of management, and magnitude of habitat alteration likely also contribute to these relationships. Collectively, our findings emphasize that there is a need to extract less or regulate better in order to conserve and benefit from biodiversity in fisheries and other natural resource management systems.},

abstract = {Marine and freshwater ecosystems are increasingly at risk of large and cascading changes from multiple human activities (termed “regime shifts”), which can impact population productivity, resilience, and ecosystem structure. Pacific salmon exhibit persistent and large fluctuations in their population dynamics driven by combinations of intrinsic (e.g., density dependence) and extrinsic factors (e.g., ecosystem changes, species interactions). In recent years, many Pacific salmon have declined due to regime shifts but clear understanding of the processes driving these changes remains elusive. Here, we unpacked the role of density dependence, ecosystem trends, and stochasticity on productivity regimes for a community of five anadromous Pacific salmonids (Steelhead, Coho Salmon, Pink Salmon, Dolly Varden, and Coastal Cutthroat Trout) across a rich 40-year time-series. We used a Bayesian multivariate state-space model to examine whether productivity shifts had similarly occurred across the community and explored marine or freshwater changes associated with those shifts. Overall, we identified three productivity regimes: an early regime (1976–1990), a compensatory regime (1991–2009), and a declining regime (since 2010) where large declines were observed for Steelhead, Dolly Varden, and Cutthroat Trout, intermediate declines in Coho and no change in Pink Salmon. These regime changes were associated with multiple cumulative effects across the salmon life cycle. For example, increased seal densities and ocean competition were associated with lower adult marine survival in Steelhead. Watershed logging also intensified over the past 40 years and was associated with (all else equal) ≥97% declines in freshwater productivity for Steelhead, Cutthroat, and Coho. For Steelhead, marine and freshwater dynamics played approximately equal roles in explaining trends in total productivity. Collectively, these changing environments limited juvenile production and lowered future adult returns. These results reveal how changes in freshwater and marine environments can jointly shape population dynamics among ecological communities, like Pacific salmon, with cascading consequences to their resilience.},

abstract = {Current methods and theory used in the study of the spatial dynamics of marine fish are problematic. Positive relationships between population abundance and occupied area are typically interpreted as evidence of density-dependent habitat selection. However. both abundance and area may co-vary with an un-parameterized variable, such as a density-independent effect. In addition. if density-dependent habitat selection is present, population growth rates in optimal habitats would be expected to be lower than in marginal habitats. This same pattern can also evolve from a large-scale. spatially autocorrelated change in a density-independent factor. The theory underlying density-dependent habitat selection, the ideal free distribution, can be tautological when no a priori information of how habitat suitability changes with density is mown. In this case, an ideal free distribution can be defined for any pattern of habitat-specific population growth rates. However, these problems are not insurmountable and solutions may be found by considering spatial variation in proxies of fitness and explicitly allowing for the relative importance of habitat selection (density dependent) and environmental (density independent) effects to vary with spatial scale.},

Such a methodology incorporates both the detailed population reconstructions of the single-species model and the broader ecosystem perspective from ecosystem-based modeling, and fits into existing management schemes. The advocated method has arisen from independent work on EBFM in two international fisheries management systems: (1) Atlantic menhaden in the United States and (2) the multi species fisheries of the Irish Sea, in the Celtic Seas ecoregion. In the Atlantic menhaden example, the objective was to develop ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for the effect of menhaden harvest on predator populations and the tradeoffs associated with forage fish management. In the Irish Sea, the objective was to account for ecosystem variability when setting quotas for the individual target species. These two exercises were aimed at different management needs, but both arrived at a process of adjusting the target
F
used within the current single-species management. Although the approach has limitations, it represents a practical step toward EBFM, which can be adapted to a range of ecosystem objectives and applied within current management systems.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary causes of dispersal can be crucial in understanding the behaviour of spatially structured populations, and predicting how species respond to environmental change. Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term ‚{\"{A}}{\`{o}}dispersal‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}, for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.},

Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of gray wolves less than 14 years after their reintroduction to Idaho and Wyoming. The "delisting" rule does not adequately address lack of genetic connectivity between Yellowstone wolf packs and other NRM populations, for which reason a federal court overturned the 2008 predecessor of the rule. The US Fish and Wildlife Service defies its own policies by delisting the Idaho and Montana portions of the DPS while Wyoming wolves remain endangered. Criteria for this delisting are inconsistent with prior delistings of recovered birds and mammals. New scientific understanding of species recovery argues for a higher delisting threshold for the NRM gray wolf metapopulation. Finally, we argue that ecosystem recovery should be a recovery criterion for this unique keystone predator. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological. Sciences. All rights reserved.},

Traditional tethering data (presence/ absence) revealed that there were significant differences in the number of predation events between sites (p = 0.037) with more predation events occurring at the St. Joseph Bay site. In addition, there were significant differences in predation between prey types (p < 0.001). Regardless of site, significantly more 'soft' bodied prey types (shrimp) were removed than 'hard' bodied prey types (brachyuran crabs). Separating the data by site revealed that there were significant differences between habitat types (seagrass interior, seagrass edge and unvegetated substrate) at the Damariscotta River site (p = 0.027), but not at the St. Joseph Bay site (p = 0.943). Using the time to predation recorded on the chronographic tethering devices, survival times were calculated. Based on prey survival time, comparisons were made between predation intensity in monotypic stands of the seagrasses Zostera marina L. (Damariscotta River) and Thalassia testudinum (St. Joseph Bay), and bare substrate and the grass edge at both study sites. There were no significant differences in survival time between habitats at the Damariscotta River site (p = 0874). However, the average prey survival time was significantly less for the seagrass bed edge at the St. Joseph Bay site than for the T. testudinum bed interior and unvegetated habitats (p = 0.019). In addition, the time to predation allowed the effect of tidal state and light versus dark on predation to be assessed. While neither tidal state nor light versus dark had any effect on predation at the Damariscotta River site (p = 0.096 and p = 0.481 respectively), at the St. Joseph Bay site, there were significantly more predation events during the day than at night (p < 0.001), regardless of tidal state (p = 0.664). The use of the chronographic tethering devices revealed that while there was no significant difference in the number of predation events or rate of predation at the St. Joseph Bay site, the interface (i.e. 'edge') between bare or unvegetated substrates and seagrass assemblages was associated with the highest predation risks.},

abstract = {Species respond to climate change with range and abundance dynamics. To better explain and predict them, we need a mechanistic understanding of how the underlying demographic processes are shaped by climatic conditions. Here, we aim to infer demography-climate relationships from distribution and abundance data. For this, we developed spatially explicit, process-based models for eight Swiss breeding bird populations. These jointly consider dispersal, population dynamics and the climate-dependence of three demographic processes - juvenile survival, adult survival and fecundity. The models were calibrated to 267 nationwide abundance time series in a Bayesian framework. The fitted models showed moderate to excellent goodness-of-fit and discriminatory power. The most influential climatic predictors for population performance were the mean breeding-season temperature and the total winter precipitation. Contemporary climate change benefitted the population trends of typical mountain birds leading to lower population losses or even slight increases, whereas lowland birds were adversely affected. Our results emphasize that generic process-based models embedded in a robust statistical framework can improve our predictions of range dynamics and may allow disentangling of the underlying processes. For future research, we advocate a stronger integration of experimental and empirical studies in order to gain more precise insights into the mechanisms by which climate affects populations.

However, response diversity may reflect important variation among local population dynamics driven by population-specific responses to regional environmental change. We used long-term data on sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from pristine watersheds of southwestern Alaska to show that populations spawning in close proximity (< 40 km) to one another have a limited degree of synchrony in their dynamics, even after accounting for density-dependent processes. In fact, the dynamics of local populations of stream-spawning sockeye salmon were no more coherent than those of stocks at a much coarser resolution across this region of Alaska. We examined four hypotheses to explain the observed patterns of asynchrony among stream-spawning populations, and found that populations spawning in dissimilar habitats, and using different nursery lakes were less synchronized in their productivity. Similarity in the age structure of spawning adults was less correlated with synchrony in productivity. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining diverse spawning and rearing habitat for the conservation of Pacific salmon, and should guide conservation planning for Pacific salmon populations in regions where natural dynamics have been altered by habitat loss, hatchery practices, and over-fishing.},

Although many quantitative models assume that larger, more fecund fish are preferentially removed by fishing, there is no empirical evidence describing the relationship between vulnerability to capture and individual reproductive fitness in the wild. Using males from two lines of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) selectively bred over three generations for either high (HV) or low (LV) vulnerability to angling as a model system, we show that the trait "vulnerability to angling" positively correlates with aggression, intensity of parental care, and reproductive fitness. The difference in reproductive fitness between HV and LV fish was particularly evident among larger males, which are also the preferred mating partners of females. Our study constitutes experimental evidence that recreational angling selectively captures individuals with the highest potential for reproductive fitness. Our study further suggests that selective removal of the fittest individuals likely occurs in many fisheries that target species engaged in parental care. As a result, depending on the ecological context, angling-induced selection may have negative consequences for recruitment within wild populations of largemouth bass and possibly other exploited species in which behavioral patterns that determine fitness, such as aggression or parental care, also affect their vulnerability to fishing gear.},

abstract = {This paper extends a state-space Bayesian mark-recapture framework to multiple-recapture data to estimate fishery-specific capture and mortality rates and seasonal movement rates for fish in different length classes. The methodology is applied to tag recapture data for white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) collected in the recreational fishery and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Ocean's test fishery at Albion in the lower Fraser River. Significant differences were found between some estimated movement rates by season and length class, supporting the notion of there being marked differences in seasonal movement patterns between different life history stages of A. transmontanus in the lower Fraser River. Uncertainty in the tag reporting rate parameter, quantified using a recreational creel sampling program, is summarized by a prior distribution. The utility of recreational fishing effort as a model covariate in accounting for seasonal and spatial variation in recapture rates is addressed using Bayesian model evaluation criteria. The data provide strong support in favour of models that include fishing effort as a covariate. The appropriate level of stratification for the recreational catchability parameter q is assessed using Bayesian model evaluation criteria; models in which q is estimated by season and length class have the highest posterior probabilities.},

abstract = {Management for sustainable fisheries requires effective tactics for limiting exploita-tion rates. Limitation based on annual stock assessments and total allowable catches cal-culated from these assessments can be very dangerous, and marine protected areas (MPAs) are one means by which to limit exploitation rate directly even when total stock size is highly uncertain. This application of MPAs would probably require much larger areas than are now envisioned for limited objectives related to protection of seed spawning stock and local biodiversity. It might in fact cause a basic shift in thinking—from regard-ing MPAs as exceptional areas to regarding fishing areas as the exception (as is now the practice in, e.g., salmon and herring fisheries). The present paper describes the use of ECOSPACE, a new modeling tool based on ecosystem simulations, for preliminary de-termination of how large MPAs need to be; ECOSPACE models suggest that dispersal, trophic responses (prey depletion, increased dispersal of predators in response to compe-tition), and spatial fishing-effort responses (concentration of fishing near MPA bound-aries) are all likely to reduce the effectiveness of small MPAs. The models suggest we should see not simple high-low density differences across MPA boundaries but rather spatial gradients from low density in exploited areas to high density near the centers of larger MPAs. Such spatial density gradients should be accompanied by spatially orga-nized 'trophic cascade' patterns if trophic interactions are important determinants of abun-dance. MPA design can work with or against spatial variation in fishing effort caused by economic cost and risk factors; ECOSPACE can help to demonstrate ecological conse-quences of alternative design strategies, but the most important uncertainties are about socioeconomic responses (cooperation or competition) rather than ecological ones. De-sign of experimental policies and monitoring programs for evaluation of MPAs should proceed from careful modeling to define likely spatial, temporal, and trophic scales for both ecological and fishing responses. A revolution is underway in thinking about how to design safe and sustainable policies for fisheries harvesting. Sad case studies (e.g., Walters and Maguire, 1996) and policy failures are beginning to teach us that very few natural populations can be adequately managed on the assumption of the old unit stock concepts—a well-mixed pool of fish with a stable production or recruitment relationship that produces a set of alternative stable population sizes dependent on harvest rates and some single level that produces the highest average yield. Instead, we generally see complex spatial stock structure that can erode over time under fishery development, production relationships that vary on long time scales with changes in environmental and trophic conditions, and harvest rates that can vary in pathological ways over time (e.g., depensatory effects) because of inadequate assessment systems and incomplete control of fishing activities. Our thinking about how to deal more effectively and safely with these complexities is resulting in a variety of controversial recommendations, ranging from large marine protected areas (Walters, 1998) to fixed-exploitation-rate strategies (Walters and Parma, 1996) to ecosystem accounting},

abstract = {Despite the disparities in size and volume of marine and freshwater realms, a strikingly similar number of species is found in each – with 15 150 Actinopterygian fishes in fresh water and 14 740 in the marine realm. Their ecological and societal values are widely recognized yet many marine and freshwater fishes increasingly risk local, regional or global extinction. The prevailing threats in aquatic systems are habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, pollution, over-exploitation and climate change. Unpredictable synergies with climate change greatly complicate the impacts of other stressors that threaten many marine and freshwater fishes. Isolated and fragmented habitats typically present the most challenging environments for small, specialized freshwater and marine fishes, whereas overfishing is by far the greatest threat to larger marine and freshwater species. Species that migrate within or between freshwater and marine realms may face high catchability in predictable migration bottlenecks, and degradation of breeding habitat, feeding habitat or the intervening migration corridors. Conservation reserves are vital to protect species-rich habitats, important radiations, and threatened endemic species. Integration of processes that connect terrestrial, freshwater and marine protected areas promises more effective conservation outcomes than disconnected reserves. Diadromous species in particular require more attention in aquatic restoration and conservation planning across disparate government agencies. Human activities and stressors that increasingly threaten freshwater and marine fishes must be curbed to avoid a wave of extinctions. Freshwater recovery programmes range from plans for individual species to recovery of entire basin faunas. Reducing risks to threatened marine species in coastal habitats also requires conservation actions at multiple scales. Most of the world's larger economically important fisheries are relatively well-monitored and well-managed but there are urgent needs to curb fishing mortality and minimize catch of the most endangered species in both realms.

The experiments were conducted at an ambient temperature of 7 °C and at an elevated temperature of 14 °C using 5 to 10 females and 3 replicates per female. The results indicate that elevated temperature may result in a faster developmental rate, a lower early-stage mortality and hatching success, smaller size-at-hatch, a larger yolk sac size, and a higher amount of larval malformations when compared to an ambient temperature. The egg and offspring traits were also associated with the maternal traits, indicating especially that thyroid hormones play a mediating role in the physiological processes.},

We derive an analytical measure which takes in account all consequences of the discrete nature of deme size. Expressions of this measure are detailed for infinite island models of population structure. As an illustration we consider the evolution of dispersal in populations made of small demes with environmental and demographic stochasticity. We confirm some results obtained from the analysis of models based on deterministic approximations. In particular, when there is an Allee effect, we show that evolution of the dispersal rate may lead the metapopulation to extinction. Thus, selection on the dispersal rate could restrict the distribution of species subject to Allee effects. This selection-driven extinction is prevented by kin selection when the environmental extinction rate is small. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract
Fishery management frequently involves precautionary buffering for scientific uncertainty. For example, a precautionary buffer that scales with scientific uncertainty is used to calculate the acceptable biological catch downward from the overfishing limit in the US federal fishery management system. However, there is little empirical guidance to suggest how large buffers for scientific uncertainty should be. One important component of uncertainty is variation among different assessments of the same stock in estimates of management‐relevant quantities. We analysed commercially exploited marine fish and invertebrate stocks around the world and developed Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify inter‐assessment variation in terminal year biomass and fishing mortality estimates, reference points, relative biomass and fishing mortality estimates, and overfishing limits. There was little evidence of inter‐assessment bias; stock assessment estimates in the terminal year of the assessment were not consistently higher or lower than estimates of the same quantities in future years. However, there was a tendency for extreme values from the terminal year to be pulled closer to the mean in future years. Inter‐assessment variation in all estimates differed across regions, and a longer inter‐assessment interval generally resulted in greater variation. Inter‐assessment uncertainty was greatest for estimates of the overfishing limit, with coefficients of variation ranging from 17\% in Europe (non‐EU) to 107\% for Pacific Ocean pelagic stocks. Because inter‐assessment variation is only one component of scientific uncertainty, we suggest that these uncertainty estimates may provide a basis for determining the minimum size of precautionary buffers.},

@article{Stier2020,
abstract = {Many organisms exhibit tremendous fluctuations in population abundance and experience unexpected collapse. Conservationists seeking to minimize region-wide variability in resources and reduce extinction risk often seek to preserve a metapopulation portfolio of spatially asynchronous subpopulations connected by dispersal. However, portfolio properties are not necessarily static, and the erosion of a portfolio can fundamentally alter the population dynamics and services a species provides. In the Northeast Pacific, a portfolio of spatially asynchronous herring populations has historically provided regional reliability of herring to mobile predators and commercial fishermen as well as local subsistence and ceremonial harvest. Here, we fit a mechanistic time-series model to herring spawn and catch records from 1950 to 2015 to quantify how population growth, climate, and fishing have contributed to a major shift in the herring portfolio over time. We document the erosion of the herring portfolio and a severe decline in herring population growth. Commercial harvest historically played a key role in herring dynamics, hovering around typical annual exploitation rates (15%) at the archipelago scale, but local harvest rates were much higher when fishing occurred (as high as 65%). Additionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on local and regional herring population dynamics. Our results highlight how spatially structured populations can undergo major shifts following disturbance and emphasize how ecological systems do not always rapidly recover and provide services following disturbance. Developing herring management strategies at a finer scale may ensure greater regional resource reliability by recovering previous levels of spatial population asynchrony. However, doing so may require higher implementation and monitoring costs in order to yield higher ecological, social, and economic benefits. Such place-based solutions that match the spatial scale of governance to the spatial scale of ecological dynamics have the potential to improve future management and conservation in an increasingly dynamic world.},

The increased availability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rapid system-wide changes triggered by predators can pose considerable challenges to people. In the Northeast Pacific, the recovery of sea otters Enhydra lutris following their extirpation due to the 18th and 19th century fur trade is driving a social-ecological regime shift with profound implications. While the ecological consequences of this shift are well documented, very little research has examined the conditions that enable or constrain people's ability to adapt to the social, economic and cultural changes that transpire. Through a collaborative partnership and workshops with Indigenous knowledge holders spanning Alaska to British Columbia, along with quantitative and qualitative interviews in two Indigenous communities among the first to experience sea otter recovery, we examined people's perceptions of the social-ecological conditions that affect their ability to adapt to these changes. We found that communities differed in their relative rankings of adaptation-enabling conditions; however, the following four broad strategies were perceived as critical to improving coexistence with sea otters: (a) strengthening Indigenous governance and decision-making authority; (b) promoting adaptive co-management; (c) weaving Indigenous knowledge and Western science into management plans and (d) establishing learning platforms. Both communities also identified that increased livelihood options and financial assistance would not compensate for lost food security. Differences in enabling conditions and attitudes towards sea otters within and between communities can be attributed to the social-ecological and political context in which sea otter recovery occurs. Our study suggests that enhancing Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to predator-induced regime shifts will require a transformation in current resource governance systems if we are to navigate towards an ecologically sustainable and socially just operating space. Overall, this work highlights the need for more Indigenous authority, knowledge and leadership in addressing predator-induced regime shifts in coupled human-ocean systems.

abstract = {An important problem in multilevel modeling is what constitutes a sufficient sample size for accurate estimation. In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.

@article{Ricker1958a,
abstract = {Using numerical models, effects of environmental variability upon yield were tested for six single-age fish stocks characterized by different kinds and degrees of density-dependent reproduction potential. The two levels of variability examined had extremes of yield standing in the ratios 7:1 and 18:1, respectively. Close regulation of fishing to the optimum percentage for each year's stock improves the long-term average catch taken, the improvement being the greater, the more variable the environment. With the higher level of variability, improvement in average catch among five of the stocks ranged from 26% to 79% increase. However this increase in mean catch is achieved at the expense of increased variability in catch from year to year—in fact, for some kinds of stocks there must be complete cessation of fishing in some years in order to get the long-term maximum. The yield of stocks, in which reproduction per spawner declines at low levels of abundance, is particularly improved by a close adaptation of fishing effort to the supply of fish available.When two or more populations of a species, characterized by different reproduction potentials, are fished in common, total potential catch is less than when each can be fished separately at its optimum level. If a common fishery cannot be avoided, the achievement of maximum average yield may find one of two originally-equal stocks as abundant or even more abundant than before the fishery began, while the other may persist only at a low level or even be exterminated completely.},

Twelve discrete behaviors or modal action patterns (MAPs) of larvae were observed at all group sizes; half these patterns are unique to larval stages. Conversely, larvae do not develop five previously described juvenile MAPs. Stereotyped metalarval feeding sequences were absent or poorly developed in prolarvae. Group size was directly related to duration of free swimming in water column (metalarvae only) and to frequencies of "proximity to another fish" (all larvae), "contact another fish" (all larvae), and "escape or flee" (all larvae). Age or larval stage significantly affected all swimming-related activities and three feeding behaviors. Larvae foraged and fed independently of one another and used MAPs typical of other larval fishes ("fixate," "sigmoid," "lunge," and "capture"). With one exception (a direct relationship between frequency of food capture and metalarval size), group size and individual size did not significantly affect larval feeding success. Neither schooling nor forms of behavior leading to coordinated group swimming were observed at either larval stage. Larval behavior differed from juvenile behavior in a way that suggests survival in riverine habitats is promoted by behavior that disperses larvae and enables them to function nonsocially.},

This trade-off is found both between morphs and within the macropterous morph, in which fecundity is negatively correlated with the mass of the principle flight muscles, the dorso-longitudinal muscles (DLM). In this paper, we examine how this trade-off is affected by a reduction in food and its genetic basis. We find that the relative fitness of the two wing morphs is not changed although both fecundity and DLM mass are decreased. A quantitative genetic analysis shows that the trade-off function is genetically variable but that most of the variation occurs in the intercept rather than the slope of the function. Analysis further indicates a very high genetic correlation between environments (food ration) supporting the hypothesis of a strong functional constraint between reproduction and flight capability.},

abstract = {Density-dependent processes have repeatedly been shown to have a central role in salmonid population dynamics, but are often assumed to be negligible for populations at low abundances relative to historical records. Density dependence has been observed in overall spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha production, but it is not clear how patterns observed at the aggregate level relate to individual populations within the basin. We used a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to explore the degree of density dependence in juvenile production for nine Idaho populations. Our results indicate that density dependence is ubiquitous, although its strength varies between populations. We also investigated the processes driving the population-level pattern and found density-dependent growth and mortality present for both common life-history strategies, but no evidence of density-dependent movement. Overwinter mortality, spatial clustering of redds and limited resource availability were identified as potentially important limiting factors contributing to density dependence. The ubiquity of density dependence for these threatened populations is alarming as stability at present low abundance levels suggests recovery may be difficult without major changes. We conclude that density dependence at the population level is common and must be considered in demographic analysis and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {The ecosystems supporting Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are changing rapidly as a result of climate change and habitat alteration. Understanding how—and how consistently—salmon populations respond to changes at regional and watershed scales has major implications for fisheries management and habitat conservation. Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) populations across Alaska have declined over the past decade, resulting in fisheries closures and prolonged impacts to local communities. These declines are associated with large-scale climate drivers, but uncertainty remains about the role of local conditions (e.g., precipitation, streamflow, and stream temperature) that vary among the watersheds where salmon spawn and rear. We estimated the effects of these and other environmental indicators on the productivity of 15 Chinook salmon populations in the Cook Inlet basin, southcentral Alaska, using a hierarchical Bayesian stock-recruitment model. Salmon spawning during 2003–2007 produced 57% fewer recruits than the previous long-term average, leading to declines in adult returns beginning in 2008. These declines were explained in part by density dependence, with reduced population productivity following years of high spawning abundance. Across all populations, productivity declined with increased precipitation during the fall spawning and early incubation period and increased with above-average precipitation during juvenile rearing. Above-average stream temperatures during spawning and rearing had variable effects, with negative relationships in many warmer streams and positive relationships in some colder streams. Productivity was also associated with regional indices of streamflow and ocean conditions, with high variability among populations. The cumulative effects of adverse conditions in freshwater, including high spawning abundance, heavy fall rains, and hot, dry summers may have contributed to the recent population declines across the region. Identifying both coherent and differential responses to environmental change underscores the importance of targeted, watershed-specific monitoring and conservation efforts for maintaining resilient salmon runs in a warming world.},

Most studies of eutrophication have been conducted long after the numbers and diversity of larger marine consumers were dramatically reduced by centuries of intense harvesting. It is now understood that these once abundant predators played pivotal roles in regulating ecosystem structure and function, and that the widespread overharvesting of large consumers can trigger indirect effects that alter species compositions in ways that are very similar to those reported to result from eutrophication. All of this suggests that we should reevaluate whether the many negative effects attributed to eutrophication are actually a result of nutrient additions or whether they may be the result of the indirect effects of dramatically altered coastal food webs. In this essay, we review experimental assessments of the degree to which changes in consumer abundances have indirectly altered the structure of benthic ecosystems in coastal waters, and on the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects on coral reefs, rocky shores, and seagrass meadows. We find that the evidence clearly indicates that indirect consumer effects are the primary drivers of coastal benthic ecosystem structure and function.},

EBSAs merge marine and coastal physical, biological and biogeographical information held by States, diverse scientific institutions and individual experts to identify inherent value of marine biodiversity, as well as providing a focus for either States or international organisations with sectoral competences to apply potential management measures to protect and sustainably manage biodiversity. In assessing information made available at dedicated EBSA Regional Workshops, several common patterns emerged, both in the data made available and in the gaps in information. The latter include missing information, representation of taxa and features of interest, and specialist expertise. The review exercise detailed here has highlighted the value and efficacy of the EBSA process and the information it has generated, despite some recognised shortcomings. It further suggests that there is potential to strengthen the EBSA portfolio by (i) adding some selected new areas yet to be described, (ii) revisiting existing EBSAs to add both new and existing information, and (iii) reconsidering some areas previously deemed to not meet the EBSA criteria by incorporating both new and existing information. Improving the systematic assessment of areas against the EBSA criteria could be achieved using a combination of (i) spatially precise systematic conservation approaches, supported by (ii) predictive modelling and biogeographic multi-criteria approaches based on expert judgement.},

abstract = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics are now recognized to be highly relevant for population and community dynamics. However, the impact of evolutionary dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated. Here, we analyse the evolutionary consequences of spatial network connectivity and topology for dispersal strategies and quantify the eco-evolutionary feedback in terms of altered classical metapopulation dynamics. We find that network properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks, and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for conservation and management of spatially structured populations.},

abstract = {Excessively high rates of fishing mortality have led to rapid declines of several commercially important fish stocks. To harvest fish stocks sustainably, fisheries management requires accurate information about population dynamics, but the generation of this information, known as fisheries stock assessment, traditionally relies on conservative and rather narrowly data-driven modelling approaches. To improve the information available for fisheries management, there is a demand to increase the biological realism of stock-assessment practices and to better incorporate the available biological knowledge and theory. Here, we explore the development of fisheries stock-assessment models with an aim to increasing their biological realism, and focus particular attention on the possibilities provided by the hierarchical Bayesian modelling framework and ways to develop this approach as a means of efficiently incorporating different sources of information to construct more biologically realistic stock-assessment models. The main message emerging from our review is that to be able to efficiently improve the biological realism of stock-assessment models, fisheries scientists must go beyond the traditional stock-assessment data and explore the resources available in other fields of biological research, such as ecology, life-history theory and evolutionary biology, in addition to utilizing data available from other stocks of the same or comparable species. The hierarchical Bayesian framework provides a way of formally integrating these sources of knowledge into the stock-assessment protocol and to accumulate information from multiple sources and over time.},

abstract = {This second edition of Hilbe's Negative Binomial Regression is a substantial enhancement to the popular first edition. The only text devoted entirely to the negative binomial model and its many variations, nearly every model discussed in the literature is addressed. The theoretical and distributional background of each model is discussed, together with examples of their construction, application, interpretation and evaluation. Complete Stata and R codes are provided throughout the text, with additional code (plus SAS), derivations and data provided on the book's website. Written for the practising researcher, the text begins with an examination of risk and rate ratios, and of the estimating algorithms used to model count data. The book then gives an in-depth analysis of Poisson regression and an evaluation of the meaning and nature of overdispersion, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the negative binomial distribution and of its parameterizations into various models for evaluating count data.},

abstract = {Externally derived resources often contribute to the structuring of ecological communities. Estuaries are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world and provide an ideal system to test how communities may be shaped by resource subsidies because they occur at the intersection of marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Here we tested the effects of both terrestrial- and salmon-derived subsidies, in addition to other factors such as habitat area, on the diet (inferred from stable isotopes), abundance and size of a mobile estuarine consumer, the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister). Crab trap surveys encompassed 19 watersheds over two seasons in the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, which spanned natural gradients in estuary size, watershed size, riparian tree composition, and Pacific salmon spawning density. Stable isotope ratios of crab tissue confirmed the predictions that estuarine nutrient regimes can be strongly affected by upstream watershed size, salmon density, and the dominance of nitrogen-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra). There were more crabs in larger estuaries and the largest crabs were found in estuaries below the largest watersheds. The proportional contributions of terrestrial- and salmon-derived subsidies to the diet of Dungeness crabs increased with watershed size and salmon density, respectively. These results confirmed that resource subsidies can constitute large proportions of the Dungeness crab's diet, that crab abundance is determined by habitat size, but that crab size is affected by the magnitude of terrestrial resource influx. {\textcopyright} 2014 Harding and Reynolds.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis models provide a tool to estimate fish abundance, recruitment, and fishing mortality from a wide variety of data. The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.},

abstract = {1. The addition of large water storage dams to rivers in California's Central Valley blocked access to spawning habitat and has resulted in a dramatic decline in the distribution and abundance of spring-run chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum 1792). Successful recovery efforts depend on an understanding of the historical spatial structure of these populations, which heretofore has been lacking. 2. Graph theory was used to examine the spatial structure and demographic con- nectivity of riverine populations of spring-run chinook salmon. Standard graph theoretic measures, including degree, edge weight and node strength, were used to uncover the role of individual populations in this network, i.e. which populations were sources and which were pseudo-sinks. 3. Larger spatially proximate populations, most notably the Pit River, served as sources in the historic graph. These source populations in the graph were marked by an increased number of stronger outbound connections (edges), and on average had few inbound connections. Of the edges in the current graph, seven of them were outbound from a population supported by a hatchery in the Feather River, which suggests a strong influence of the hatchery on the structure of the current extant populations. 4. We tested how the addition of water storage dams fragmented the graph over time by examining changing patterns in connectivity and demographic isolation of individual populations. Dams constructed in larger spatially proximate populations had a strong impact on the independence of remaining populations. Specifically, the addition of dams resulted in lost connections, weaker remaining connections and an increase in demographic isolation. 5. A simulation exercise that removed populations from the graph under different removal scenarios – random removal, removal by decreasing habitat size and removal by decreasing node strength – revealed a potential approach for restoration of these depleted populations. 6. Synthesis and applications. Spatial graphs are drawing the attention of ecologists and managers. Here we have used a directed graph to uncover the historical spatial structure of a threatened species, estimate the connectivity of the current populations, examine how the historical network of populations was fragmented over time and provide a plausible mechanism for ecologically successful restoration. The methods employed here can be applied broadly across taxa and systems, and afford scientists and managers a better understanding of the structure and function of impaired ecosystems.},

abstract = {Species-specific production rate per unit biomass (P/B, per year) ratios were calculated for 79 freshwater fish species of eastern Canada. P/B (per year) ratios were calculated using two methods, which were based on allometry with fish weight-at-maturity and life expectancy, respectively. P/B (per year) values obtained by the two methods were significantly correlated, as expected from life history theory, since the two predictors (longevity, size-at-maturity) were themselves correlated. Species-specific P/B (per year) ratios were also significantly correlated with field observations of P/B from published sources. The estimation of P/B based on allometry with fish size is recommended because of its utility; the predictive equation is P/B (per year) = 2.64Wmat −035. , where Wmat is weight-at-maturity. Both the coefficient 2.64 and the exponent –0.35 of this equation are provisional and require further validation from field studies of fish production. More accurate estimates of P/B are possible if population-specific information on size-at-maturity or mean size is known. The product of average fish biomass and estimated P/B coefficients (habitat productivity index (HPI) = B × P/B) is a proposed measure of habitat productive capacity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. For many fish species, variation in somatic growth can drive changes in population productivity through the dependence of survival, fecundity, and reproductive schedules on size. Changes in growth arise from many density-dependent and -independent sources. Many assessments of temporal variation in somatic growth rely on methods that lack biological underpinning in the model structure to describe observed relationships between size and environmental conditions. However, biologically-based growth models are needed to examine how density-dependent and −independent factors influence the underlying process of growth (i.e., growth = anabolic factors − catabolic factors). Our objective was to extend biologically-based growth models to estimate temporal variation in somatic growth patterns. A set of hierarchical non-linear mixed effects models based off the von Bertalanffy model and length-weight relationship were developed. We applied the models to a Black Crappie (BC; Pomoxis nigromaculatus) population to assess the impacts of density, chlorophyll A concentration (Chl-a), water level, and temperature on somatic growth. Growth in length was influenced by temperature, with fastest growth at optimal temperatures and slower growth when temperatures were coldest (48% slower) or hottest (82% slower), and was negatively related to density, with 25% slower growth at high density. Weight of age-0 BC was negatively related to chlorophyll A, individuals were 18% lighter at high Chl-a, and positively to temperature, individuals were 10% lighter when water was cooler. Finally, growth in weight of age-1+ BC was negatively related to all factors, with 5–11% lighter fish at high densities, Chl-a, water levels, and temperatures. The model structure developed in this manuscript has broad applicability to populations that have time series data of size-at-age observations, growth increments, or back-calculated sizes and adequate environmental data.},

abstract = {The biomass of small pelagic fish species off the coast of South Africa has been monitored since 1984 using hydro-acoustic survey techniques. These time-series of spawner biomass and recruitment estimates form the basis for management of both the South African sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resources and are central to the setting of annual total allowable catch levels. However, these survey estimates have, for the most part, been treated as relative indices as there are several biases inherent in acoustic survey methodology that remain difficult to quantify. Advances in acoustic technology together with an improved understanding of the major sources of survey errors have enabled estimation of and correction for biases such as receiver saturation, acoustic signal attenuation and target strength. Incorporation of these corrections over the entire time-series has resulted in an improved accuracy of acoustic survey estimates and substantial changes to the biomass estimates of both species, without jeopardising the requirement that the time-series remains comparable throughout its duration. Furthermore, the resultant decrease in the level of uncertainty associated with these abundance estimates has rendered improved utilisation of these resources possible.

abstract = {Recent surveys of recovery plans indicate that criteria, such as population sizes, for delisting species from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) are often unrealistically low by scientific standards. We describe the delisting criterion for the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) developed by the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Team. A major oil spill is the most serious threat to this sea otter population. After extensive modeling of oil spills, the recovery team concluded that it was not scientifically defensible to develop a delisting criterion in terms of a single probability of extinction over a specified time period. Instead, the team decided to define a size at which it would consider the population endangered and to consider the population threatened as long as a major oil spill might reduce it to that size. The effective population size (N(c)) for endangered status was set at 500, estimated to be about 1850 otters. Using a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez spill (250,000 bbl), the oil spill model was iterated to generate a frequency distribution of the number of sea otters contacted by oil, from which the team estimated that less than 800 otters would be killed by 90% of the simulated spills. Thus, the delisting criterion was set at 1850 + 800 = 2650 individuals. There have been several proposals to improve the Endangered Species Act by providing quantitative guidance, in the form of specific probabilities of extinction within some time frame or specific criteria like those used by the World Conservation Union as to the levels of extinction risk represented by the terms 'threatened' and 'endangered.' Experiences of the Sea Otter Recovery Team indicate that guidelines should not be overly rigid and should allow flexibility for dealing with specific situations. The most important consideration is to appoint a recovery team that is both technically well qualified and unconstrained by pressures from management agencies.},

abstract = {Changes in population demographic structure can have tangible but unknown effects on management effectiveness. Fishery management of Pacific salmon is often informed by estimates of the number of spawners expected to produce maximum sustainable yield (SMSY), which implicitly assumes that reproductive output per spawner does not change over time. However, many salmon populations have experienced long-term trends in age, sex, and length-at-age compositions that have resulted in smaller body sizes of mature fish. We present an empirically-based simulation approach for evaluating management implications of declining reproductive output that results from shifting demographics. We simulated populations with or without demographic trends, selective or unselective harvests, and harvest policies based on assessment methods that did or did not account for demographic trends when estimating SMSY. A management strategy evaluation showed that expected mean harvests and run sizes were reduced when populations exhibited negative demographic trends. Reduced abundances and increased conservation risks could be partially mitigated by using a stock-recruit analysis based on egg mass instead of spawner abundance, or by using a precautionary management strategy where target escapements were higher than the estimated SMSY, especially in fisheries that selectively removed large fish. Accounting for demographic trends in stock-recruit analyses resulted in up to 25% higher run sizes and up to 20% lower conservation risks compared to traditional methods when trends toward smaller, younger, and male-biased runs were present in the population. Conservation of population demographic structure may be critical for sustaining productive fish populations and their benefits to ecosystems and people. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {This article discusses the influence of phenology-related intraseasonal asynchrony on metapopulation dynamics and stability. As the part played by intraseasonal asynchrony is as yet unclear and poorly described, greater account of it should be taken in both metapopulation research and conservation practice. The subpopulations of the Parnassius mnemosyne metapopulation studied here are strongly isolated because of the phenological shift between them, despite the relatively small physical distances between them. This isolation is the result of a significant temporal shift in the species' flight periods in the main metapopulation centers: in some seasons its flight times in the different subpopulations did not overlap at all. The predicted results of such strong intraseasonal asynchrony are not altogether clear. On the one hand, they reduce the vulnerability of the entire metapopulation to the effects of short-term random disasters. On the other, the ever-greater isolation of subpopulations may cause the metapopulation to become a nonequilibrium one, which will have a serious impact on its long-term survival.},

abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat{\'{e}}rn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of, between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Statistical Society.},

Owing to the periodicity of environmental change (e.g., seasons) and animal life-cycles (e.g., growth and maturation) locations become favorable, lose favorability and become favorable again at somewhat regular intervals. Migratory animals have adapted to these predictable fluctuations by moving among locations, sometimes over extraordinary distances (Figure 1).

abstract = {A challenge in implementing biodiversity conservation is in reconciling criteria for identifying significant areas and representative networks for biodiversity protection. Many international environmental initiatives include biological, ecological, economic, social and governance criteria to aid selection of areas for biodiversity conservation. Here we reviewed criteria used by 15 international initiatives, and what minimum set of biodiversity variables would be needed to support them. From a range of ecological and biological criteria, we identified eight criteria commonly used to identify areas for biodiversity conservation across these initiatives. Four criteria identified areas that (1) contained unique and rare habitats; (2) included fragile and sensitive habitats; (3) were important for ecological integrity; and (4) were representative of all habitats. Another four criteria were based on species' attributes, including (5) the presence of species of conservation concern; (6) the occurrence of restricted-range species; (7) species richness; and (8) importance for life history stages. Information required to inform these criteria include: habitat cover, species occurrence, species richness, species' geographic range and population abundance. This synthesized set of ecological and biological criteria, and their biodiversity variables will simplify the process to identify additional areas of high biodiversity significance, that in turn support achieving the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) targets to fill gaps in the representativeness of the global coverage of protected areas.},

The proposed recruitment curve generalizes earlier models by Ricker, Schaefer, and Beverton and Holt, where a shape parameter gamma determines the curve type. A family including these classical models can be represented analytically in terms of gamma and two management parameters: the maximum sustainable catch C* and harvest rate h*. In particular, the Picker curve can be expressed in terms of (C*, h*), rather than the classical parameters (alpha, beta). We describe the biological and management implications ofthis mathematical transformation and show that it is particularly amenable to a Bayesian formulation. We use simulation-estimation experiments to demonstrate that the new parameter estimates reduce statistical bias problems described in the literature for classical estimates. Furthermore, the new estimates are reasonably robust to the choice of shape parameter, whereas classical estimates are not. By focusing on management parameters (C*, h*) rather than productivity parameters (alpha, beta), the approach here yields estimates with improved statistical properties and direct relevance to policy.},

abstract = {There is widespread concern for many understorey and ground-dwelling bird species in the Philippines that appear intolerant of forest alteration. We present density estimates for 18 key bird species in old growth forest, advanced and early secondary growth and active cultivation within the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan. Six species were not recorded in cultivation and the abundance of these and several others increased along the successional gradient from cultivation to old growth forest. Eleven species, including five endemics and three of four threatened species, had highest density estimates in old growth forest. However, several species had high density estimates in the heavily disturbed habitats and every habitat type held highest densities of at least one of the bird species. The commonest habitat association across the bird community was a preference for areas containing large trees, indicating the importance of retention of such trees in allowing suitable ground and understorey microhabitats to persist. Old growth forests have the highest conservation value for Palawan-s endemic birds and, while some species thrive in the anthropogenic habitats that occur within the Park, the present extent of cultivation and associated successional stages within its boundaries should not be increased. We caution against extrapolation of the abundance figures from the Park to the whole island but we suggest that population sizes for the threatened species are likely to be much greater than previously thought. We urge authorities to strengthen management within the protected area network in Palawan to ensure survival of key species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Fauna & Flora International.},

abstract = {Population and life-history diversity can buffer species from environmental variability and contribute to long-term stability through differing responses to varying conditions akin to the stabilizing effect of asset diversity on financial portfolios. While it is well known that many salmon populations have declined in abundance over the last century, we understand less about how different dimensions of diversity may have shifted. Specifically, how has diminished wild abundance and increased artificial production (i.e. enhancement) changed portfolios of salmon populations, and how might such change influence fisheries and ecosystems? We apply modern genetic tools to century-old sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka scales from Canada's Skeena River watershed to (a) reconstruct historical abundance and age-trait data for 1913–1947 to compare with recent information, (b) quantify changes in population and life-history diversity and the role of enhancement in population dynamics, and (c) quantify the risk to fisheries and local ecosystems resulting from observed changes in diversity and enhancement. The total number of wild sockeye returning to the Skeena River during the modern era is 69% lower than during the historical era; all wild populations have declined, several by more than 90%. However, enhancement of a single population has offset declines in wild populations such that aggregate abundances now are similar to historical levels. Population diversity has declined by 70%, and life-history diversity has shifted: populations are migrating from freshwater at an earlier age, and spending more time in the ocean. There also has been a contraction in abundance throughout the watershed, which likely has decreased the spatial extent of salmon provisions to Indigenous fisheries and local ecosystems. Despite the erosion of portfolio strength that this salmon complex hosted a century ago, total returns now are no more variable than they were historically perhaps in part due to the stabilizing effect of artificial production. Policy implications. Our study provides a rare example of the extent of erosion of within-species biodiversity over the last century of human influence. Rebuilding a diversity of abundant wild populations—that is, maintaining functioning portfolios—may help ensure that watershed complexes like the Skeena are robust to global change.},

abstract = {The 29 estimators of natural mortality (M) that have been proposed for ‘informa- tion-limited' fisheries are reviewed, together with a new alternative presented here. Each is applied to 13 example populations for which well-founded estimates are available of both M and the estimators' parameters. None of the 30 can provide accurate estimates for every species, and none appears sufficiently precise for use in analytical stock assessments, while several perform so poorly as to have no practi- cal utility. If the growth coefficient K has been reliably estimated, either M = 1.5 K or Pauly's long-established estimator can provide useful estimates of M, but they fail with species that have long adult lives after swift juvenile growth, with those that never reach their asymptotic lengths and with species that otherwise deviate from archetypal teleost life histories. If a pre-exploitation maximum observed age (Tmax) can be established, M can be estimated for both teleosts and sharks using M = 4.3/Tmax but that seriously underestimates when the effective sample size (ne) is large and overestimates with species showing pronounced senescence. The new estimator presented here addresses ne but is upset by even mild senescence. Some estimators of M-at-size, particularly ones recently advanced by Gislason et al. and Charnov et al., also show promise but require further examination. It is recom- mended that fisheries scientists measure M by more advanced methods whenever possible. If ‘information-limited' estimators must be used, their uncertainties should be acknowledged and their errors propagated into management advice.},

abstract = {Multi-species statistical catch at age models (MSCAA) can quantify interacting effects of climate and fisheries harvest on species populations, and evaluate management trade-offs for fisheries that target several species in a food web. We modified an existing MSCAA model to include temperature-specific growth and predation rates and applied the modified model to three fish species, walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), from the eastern Bering Sea (USA). We fit the model to data from 1979 through 2012, with and without trophic interactions and temperature effects, and use projections to derive single- and multi-species biological reference points (BRP and MBRP, respectively) for fisheries management. The multi-species model achieved a higher over-all goodness of fit to the data (i.e. lower negative log-likelihood) for pollock and Pacific cod. Variability from water temperature typically resulted in 5–15% changes in spawning, survey, and total biomasses, but did not strongly impact recruitment estimates or mortality. Despite this, inclusion of temperature in projections did have a strong effect on BRPs, including recommended yield, which were higher in single-species models for Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder that included temperature compared to the same models without temperature effects. While the temperature-driven multi-species model resulted in higher yield MBPRs for arrowtooth flounder than the same model without temperature, we did not observe the same patterns in multi-species models for pollock and Pacific cod, where variability between harvest scenarios and predation greatly exceeded temperature-driven variability in yield MBRPs. Annual predation on juvenile pollock (primarily cannibalism) in the multi-species model was 2–5 times the annual harvest of adult fish in the system, thus predation represents a strong control on population dynamics that exceeds temperature-driven changes to growth and is attenuated through harvest-driven reductions in predator populations. Additionally, although we observed differences in spawning biomasses at the accepted biological catch (ABC) proxy between harvest scenarios and single- and multi-species models, discrepancies in spawning stock biomass estimates did not translate to large differences in yield. We found that multi-species models produced higher estimates of combined yield for aggregate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) targets than single species models, but were more conservative than single-species models when individual MSY targets were used, with the exception of scenarios where minimum biomass thresholds were imposed. Collectively our results suggest that climate and trophic drivers can interact to affect MBRPs, but for prey species with high predation rates, trophic- and management-driven changes may exceed direct effects of temperature on growth and predation. Additionally, MBRPs are not inherently more conservative than single-species BRPs. This framework provides a basis for the application of MSCAA models for tactical ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions under changing climate conditions.},

abstract = {The interaction of local populations has been the focus of an increasing number of studies in the past 30 years. The study of source-sink dynamics has especially generated much interest. Many of the criteria used to distinguish sources and sinks incorporate the process of apparent survival (i.e., the combined probability of true survival and site fidelity) but not emigration. These criteria implicitly treat emigration as mortality, thus biasing the classification of sources and sinks in a manner that could lead to flawed habitat management. Some of the same criteria require rather restrictive assumptions about population equilibrium that, when violated, can also generate misleading inference. Here, we expand on a criterion (denoted "contribution" or Cr) that incorporates successful emigration in differentiating sources and sinks and that makes no restrictive assumptions about dispersal or equilibrium processes in populations of interest. The metric Cr is rooted in the theory of matrix population models, yet it also contains clearly specified parameters that have been estimated in previous empirical research. We suggest that estimates of emigration are important for delineating sources and sinks and, more generally, for evaluating how local populations interact to generate overall system dynamics. This suggestion has direct implications for issues such as species conservation and habitat management.},

abstract = {Standardised sampling protocols for monitoring fish stocks are essential to assess changes in stock status and provide a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fisheries management measures, such as marine protected areas (MPAs). This study aimed to optimise two standard sampling methods, namely underwater visual census (UVC) and controlled angling, for assessing subtidal reef fish communities. In terms of efficiency, variability and bias, UVC transects were found to be superior to point counts. For controlled angling, an effort of two angler-hours per fishing station provided low catch variability, high catch per unit effort and a representative catch. Whereas UVC provided less variable estimates of relative density, controlled angling provided greater sampling efficiency. It is thus recommended that the two methods be used in conjunction. The optimal sampling protocols identified are suitable for rapid assessments or long-term monitoring of subtidal, temperate reef fish communities.

abstract = {The value of big old fat fecund female fish (BOFFFFs) in fostering stock productivity and stability has long been underappreciated by conventional fisheries science and management, although Hjort (1914) indirectly alluded to the importance of maternal effects. Compared with smaller mature females, BOFFFFs in a broad variety of marine and freshwater teleosts produce far more and often larger eggs that may develop into larvae that grow faster and withstand starvation better. As (if not more) importantly, BOFFFFs in batch-spawning species tend to have earlier and longer spawning seasons and may spawn in different locations than smaller females. Such features indicate that BOFFFFs are major agents of bet-hedging strategies that help to ensure individual reproductive success in environments that vary tremendously in time and space. Even if all else were equal, BOFFFFs can outlive periods that are unfavourable for successful reproduction and be ready to spawn profusely and enhance recruitment when favourable conditions return (the storage effect). Fishing differentially removes BOFFFFs, typically resulting in severe truncation of the size and age structure of the population. In the worst cases, fishing mortality acts as a powerful selective agent that inhibits reversal of size and age truncation, even if fishing intensity is later reduced. Age truncation is now known to destabilize fished populations, increasing their susceptibility to collapse. Although some fisheries models are beginning to incorporate maternal and other old-growth effects, most continue to treat all spawning-stock biomass as identical: many small young females are assumed to contribute the same to stock productivity as an equivalent mass of BOFFFFs. A growing body of knowledge dictates that fisheries productivity and stability would be enhanced if management conserved old-growth age structure in fished stocks, be it by limiting exploitation rates, by implementing slot limits, or by establishing marine reserves, which are now known to seed surrounding fished areas via larval dispersal. Networks of marine reserves are likely to be the most effective means of ensuring that pockets of old-growth age structure survive throughout the geographic range of demersal species.},

abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis can be a useful method for improving estimation of key parameters for harvested fish populations. In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

abstract = {Diverse taxa from many systems must make tradeoffs between food and safety. However, few studies have examined the response of multiple fish species to food and predation risk at night across their foraging landscape. In Biscayne Bay, Florida (USA), we investigated the influences of food and predation risk on nocturnal habitat use of gray snapper, bluestriped grunt and seabream along a distance gradient spanning from the mangrove-seagrass ecotone to 120 m offshore. Seine and submerged vegetation sampling were used to determine the distribution of fishes and their food resources. Tethering experiments were used to explore gradients in predator encounter rates. We used these data to test the following a priori predictions of fish distributions relative to food and risk as generated from foraging theory: (1) fishes will be distributed in proportion to their food supply (i.e. ideal free distribution, IFD); or (2) fishes will avoid high-risk areas such that their abundances will be lower than predicted by food resources in high-risk habitats (i.e. food-risk tradeoff). Results indicated that none of the fishes were distributed according to IFD. Seabream and gray snapper avoided foraging close to shore, where their food was abundant, but risk was highest. Bluestriped grunt responses to spatial variation in food supply and risk were less clear; they appeared to forage randomly across the distance gradient. Our results suggest that fish generally avoid the risky mangrove-seagrass ecotone, but responses to variation in food and risk are species-specific and may be dependent on specific anti-predator tactics or influenced by factors we did not measure.},

abstract = {Fisheries provide food. In industrialized nations, the overwhelming portion of seafood comes from a small number of commercial fishers and increasingly aquaculture (1). Fisheries also contribute to leisure and recreation. In developed nations, 1 in 10 people fishes for pleasure, amounting to at least 220 million recreational fishers worldwide (2, 3)—more than 5 times the number of commercial capture fishers (1). This means that the vast majority of people fishing today do so recreationally (Fig. 1). For too long, the considerable importance and impacts of recreational fisheries have been ignored. Image credit: Florian M{\"{o}}llers (photographer). And yet, for too long, the considerable importance and impacts of recreational fisheries have been ignored. Policymakers and managers need to acknowledge and address the recreational fisheries sector, rethink management objectives and schemes, involve recreational fishers in decision-making processes, incentivize sustainable angler behavior, and improve data collection and monitoring. Recreational fisheries deserve to be considered on equal footing with commercial fisheries, particularly in mixed coastal fisheries. Although commercial capture fisheries globally harvest about 8 times the fish biomass caught by recreational fisheries (4), in many localities recreational landings now rival or even exceed the biomass removals by commercial fisheries. In inland waters in the temperate zone, recreational anglers are now the predominant users of wild fish stocks (5), and recreational fishers have become prevalent in many coastal and marine fisheries (6, 7). Globally, recreational fishers catch about 47 billion individual fish per year, of which more than half are released alive (4), either because of harvest regulations or in response to personal ethics (8). Despite high release rates, fishing for food is a strong motive and justification for recreational fisheries (9). Beyond nutritional benefits, recreational fisheries provide a range of psychological, social, educational, and economic benefits to fishers and society that are {\ldots} [↵][1]2To whom correspondence should be addressed.

abstract = {We describe a model for the evolutionary consequences of plasticity in an environmentally heterogeneous metapopulation in which specialists for each of two alternative environments and one plastic type are initially present. The model is similar to that proposed by Moran (1992) but extends her work to two sites. We show that with migration between sites the plastic type is favored over local specialists across a broad range of parameter space. The plastic type may dominate or be fixed even in an environmentally uniform site, and even if the plasticity has imperfect accuracy or bears some cost such that a local specialist has higher fitness in that site, as long as there is some migration between sites with different distributions of environmental states. These results suggest that differences among taxa in dispersal and hence realized migration rates may play a heretofore unrecognized role in their patterns of adaptive population differentiation. Migration relaxes the thresholds for both environmental heterogeneity and accuracy of plastic response above which plasticity is favored. Furthermore, small changes in response accuracy can dramatically and abruptly alter the evolutionary outcome in the metapopulation. A fitness cost to plasticity will substantially reduce the range of conditions in which the plastic type will prevail only if the cost is both large and global rather than environment specific.},

abstract = {In order to explore mechanistic linkages between low-frequency ocean/climate variability, and fish population responses, we undertook comparative studies of time-series of recruitment-related productivity and the biomass levels of fish stocks representing five life-history strategies in the northern North Pacific between the 1950s and the present. We selected seven species: Japanese sardine (Sardinopus melanostictus) and California sardine (Sardinopus sagax) (opportunistic strategists), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma, intermediate strategist), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, salmonic strategist), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (periodic strategists) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, equilibrium strategist). The responses in terms of productivity of sardine, pink salmon, sablefish and halibut to climatic regime shifts were generally immediate, delayed, or no substantial responses depending on the particular regime shift year and fish stock (population). In walleye pollock, there were some periods of high productivity and low productivity, but not coincidental to climatic regime shifts, likely due to indirect climate forcing impacts on both bottom-up and top-down processes. Biomass of zooplankton and all fish stocks examined, except for spiny dogfish whose data were limited, indicated a decadal pattern with the most gradual changes in periodic strategists and most intensive and rapid changes in opportunistic strategists. Responses of sardine productivity to regime shifts were the most intense, probably due to the absence of density-dependent effects and the availability of refuges from predators when sardine biomass was extremely low. Spiny dogfish were least affected by environmental variability. Conversely, spiny dogfish are likely to withstand only modest harvest rates due to their very low intrinsic rate of increase. Thus, each life-history strategy type had a unique response to climatic forcing, owing to their inherent biological traits such as mode, frequency and intensity of reproduction, early life style, age of maturity and longevity. On the other hand, responses of different stocks within a species to climatic regime shifts were unique to each local region, because large-scale climatic forcings are modulated by local physical, chemical and biological processes. The observed response time or absence of response in recruitment-related fish productivity to climatic regime shifts may be influenced by (1) local environmental conditions (immediate, with a delay or no effects), (2) phenological shifts in zooplankton life-history (immediate or with a delay), and (3) stochastic episodic events in both top-down and bottom-up processes (immediate, with a delay or no effects). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nutrient-rich waters along the Pacific coast of North America support diverse fish communities that have helped sustain coastal peoples for millennia. Five Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations on the west coast of what is now known as Vancouver Island, Canada, hold constitutional Indigenous rights to conduct a multispecies community fishery, which includes Pacific Halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). A 2009 court decision defined the extent of these Indigenous rights to be within 9 nm of the coast, thereby not fully recognizing the knowledge and authority of the traditional leadership and raising concerns about the potential for an increase in rockfish bycatch. Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are a potential ‘choke' species for this fishery because the two species occupy similar depth ranges. A choke species is one that is caught incidentally while targeting other species and, if caught in excess of its quota limits, can trigger a halt to fishing on the target species. Guided by the insights of local Indigenous peoples and using both fishery-independent survey and commercial longline catch data, we investigated the effects of fishing depth and spatial restriction on the relative catch weights of these two species using spatiotemporal models. We find evidence that a confined fishing area can limit opportunities for avoiding choke species. Specifically, fishing at depths deeper than 175 m, which occur outside the court defined area (CDA), would provide more opportunities for catching halibut while avoiding Yelloweye Rockfish than are currently available within the CDA. This Indigenous-informed, analytical approach to a management problem is just one example of how Western scientists can engage in coproduction of knowledge with Indigenous peoples to transition from the ‘status quo' towards a practice of ‘Two-Eyed Seeing' that more effectively balances Indigenous rights and species conservation. Policy implications: Our study highlights (1) the importance of considering choke species distributions and opportunities for their avoidance when implementing spatial harvest restrictions and (2) how related analytical and management decisions can benefit from being guided by the advice of Indigenous knowledge holders.

The herring fishery collapsed four years later. The role of the spill, if any, in this decline remains one of the most controversial unanswered questions in modern natural resource injury assessment. Crude oil disrupts excitation-contraction coupling in fish heart muscle cells, and we show here that salmon and herring exposed as embryos to trace levels of crude oil grow into juveniles with abnormal hearts and reduced cardiorespiratory function, the latter a key determinant of individual survival and population recruitment. Oil exposure during cardiogenesis led to specific defects in the outflow tract and compact myocardium, and a hypertrophic response in spongy myocardium, evident in juveniles 7 to 9 months after exposure. The thresholds for developmental cardiotoxicity were remarkably low, suggesting the scale of the Exxon Valdez impact in shoreline spawning habitats was much greater than previously appreciated. Moreover, an irreversible loss of cardiac fitness and consequent increases in delayed mortality in oil-exposed cohorts may have been important contributors to the delayed decline of pink salmon and herring stocks in Prince William Sound.},

abstract = {Summary 1. A large share of tree species in tropical forests exhibit preference for certain habitats, resulting in strong abundance differences across habitats. While the occurrence of such habitat preference is now documented for over a thousand species, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. How are subpopulations in non-preferred habitats able to survive? Theoretical studies have suggested that these subpopulations are maintained by source–sink dynamics –‘recruitment subsidies' from high-density to low-density subpopulations – but empirical tests are lacking. 2. Here, we evaluate the role of recruitment subsidies in maintaining subpopulations of a rainforest tree in non-preferred habitats. Our study species Scaphium borneense (Sterculiaceae) shows strong habitat preference for drier ridges at Lambir Hills, Malaysia, where it occurs at ninefold higher densities than in the wetter valleys. On slopes, Scaphium occurs at intermediate densities. 3. We estimated source–sink exchange between subpopulations in three habitats in a 52-ha plot, using nearest-neighbour analyses. We found evidence for strong recruitment subsidies to the non-preferred habitats: 83–91% of recruits (of 1 cm diameter) in the valley had likely mother trees in another habitat. For slope recruits this was 54–78%. 4. We then used 10-year demographic data to construct multi-state matrix models that included the dynamics within, and exchange of recruits between subpopulations. We found that blocking recruitment subsidies to valley and slope subpopulations led to strong reductions in subpopulation growth rates over 100 years ($\lambda$100). By contrast, $\lambda$100 of the ridge population was hardly affected by blocking recruitment exchange. 5. Elasticity analysis confirmed the importance of recruitment subsidies for $\lambda$100 in valley and slope subpopulations: elasticity of recruitment subsidies to these subpopulations was three to five times larger than local recruitment. Again, the reverse pattern was found for the preferred habitat, where elasticity for recruitment from other habitats was very low. 6.Synthesis.

Migration patterns are often asymmetric and heterogeneous, with important consequences on the ecology and evolution of the species. Here we investigate experimentally how asymmetric migration and heterogeneous structure affect a simple metapopulation of budding yeast, formed by one strain that produces a public good and a non-producer strain that benefits from it. We study metapopulations with star topology and asymmetric migration, finding that all their subpopulations have a higher fraction of producers than isolated populations. Furthermore, the metapopulations have lower tolerance to challenging environments but higher resilience to transient perturbations. This apparent paradox occurs because tolerance to a constant challenge depends on the weakest subpopulations of the network, while resilience to a transient perturbation depends on the strongest ones.},

We conducted dockside surveys with both Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv fishers and sport fishers, and in-depth interviews with Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv fishers, community members, and natural resource managers. From these surveys and interviews we quantified satisfaction among both food, social, and ceremonial fishers and visiting recreational fishers with the current salmon fishery and associated social-ecological drivers, and characterized perceptions among Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv people of salmon fisheries and management. Second, we synthesized community perceptions of the revitalization of terminal, communally run salmon fisheries within Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv territory as a tool for their future salmon management. Finally, we elicited information from Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv fishers about the barriers people in their community currently face in accessing salmon fisheries. Our findings suggest that low salmon abundance, increased fishing competition, and high costs associated with participation in marine mixed-stock fisheries currently hinder access and equity for Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv fishers.

For composition data, where a multinomial likelihood is often applied, weights are determined by input sample sizes, which can be an important contributor to model results. We used a generic bootstrap method, verified through simulation, to calculate year-specific maximum realized sample sizes from the observation error inherent in fishery biological data. Applying this method to length-composition observations for 47 groundfish species collected during a standardized trawl survey, we found maximum realized sample size to be related to both the number of hauls and individual fish sampled from those hauls. Sampling in excess of 20 fish from each haul produced little increase in most cases, with maximum realized sample size ranging from approximately 2 to 4 per haul sampled. Utilizing these maximum realized sample sizes as input values for stock assessment (analogous to minimum variance estimates) appropriately incorporates interannual variability, and may reduce over-emphasis on composition data. Results from this method can also help determine sampling targets.},

The impacts range from impacts occurring directly on the exploited species (truncation of the natural age and size structure, depensatory mechanisms, loss of genetic variability, evolutionary changes), to those that occur on the aquatic ecosystem (changes in trophic cascades, trait-mediated effects).

With mounting evidence of the impacts of climate variability and change on aquatic ecosystems, the resulting impacts on fisheries livelihoods are likely to be significant, but remain a neglected area in climate adaptation policy. Drawing upon our research and the available literature, and using a livelihoods framework, this paper synthesizes the pathways through which climate variability and change impact fisherfolk livelihoods at the household and community level. We identify current and potential adaptation strategies and explore the wider implications for local livelihoods, fisheries management and climate policies. Responses to climate change can be anticipatory or reactive and should include: (1) management approaches and policies that build the livelihood asset base, reducing vulnerability to multiple stressors, including climate change; (2) an understanding of current response mechanisms to climate variability and other shocks in order to inform planned adaptation; (3) a recognition of the opportunities that climate change could bring to the sector; (4) adaptive strategies designed with a multi-sector perspective; and (5) a recognition of fisheries potential contribution to mitigation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These patterns are likely to be influenced by the combination of temporally variable environmental conditions, movement constraints imposed by network structure, and the trait composition of local communities. We developed a simplified metacommunity model to investigate complex interactions among these factors under lottery competition for local resources, such as establishment sites. We used this model to examine how local and regional community composition varied in 3 scenarios: a null implementation involving only spatial effects, an implementation that combined network constraints with dispersal-trait variation, and an implementation in which a trade-off between multiple functional traits was paired with varying levels of temporal autocorrelation in the intensity of mortality. These simulations clarified the conditions that allow a single functional strategy to exclude others in a dendritic network and demonstrated 2 distinct modes of regional partitioning that can support the persistence of multiple functional strategies within such networks. The results suggested that the emergence of watershed or headwater-outlet partitioning depends on the functional dispersal differences present in the metacommunity and that autocorrelated mortality levels can collapse these regional divisions when they depend on a trade-off between dispersal ability and mortality resistance. We discuss the need to confront the complexity of interacting controls on community composition in rivers and streams and suggest opportunities to move beyond the basic framework we present.},

abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

abstract = {After near extinction as a result of the fur trade in the 1700s and 1800s, the southern sea otter slowly reoccupied the core of its range in central California. Range expansion beyond central California is seen as key to full recovery of otters, but the rate of expansion has been sporadic, raising concerns about habitat quality in southern California. To describe the range expansion of sea otters from central into southern California, we used skiff surveys, aerial surveys, and archival time-depth recorders from 2004 to 2013. These observations show that range expansion began when male otters swam southeast of Point Conception (Cojo Anchorage), perhaps to seek refuge from bad weather and to feed on unexploited resources. After several years of seasonal use by male groups, females began to use the area, leading to reproduction and a secondary increase in abundance. In contrast, a second male group that moved farther down the coast to Coal Oil Point stalled and retreated. Such range expansion and contraction can be explained by the social nature of sea otters, which acts to slow dispersal away from groups. Otter densities at Cojo Anchorage are now approaching equilibrium levels reported for central California. As in central California, otters rested in and near kelp forest habitat, but used deeper water for foraging. Together, these observations suggest habitat in the Santa Barbara Channel can still support sea otters, but range expansion of otters into southern California will be episodic due to social dynamics.

abstract = {Fish biodiversity sustains the resilience and productivity of fisheries, yet this biodiversity can be threatened by overharvest and depletion in mixed‐stock fisheries. Thus, the biodiversity that provides benefits may also make sustainable resource extraction more difficult, a key challenge in fisheries management. We simulated a mixed‐stock fishery to explore relationships between different dimensions of biodiversity and fishery performance relative to conservation and fishery objectives. Different dimensions of biodiversity (number of stocks, evenness, asynchrony among stocks, heterogeneity in stock productivity) exacerbated trade‐offs between fishery and conservation objectives. For example, fisheries targeting stock‐complexes with greater asynchrony, and to a lesser extent richness, had greater stability in harvest through time but also greater risks of overfishing weak stocks and reduced yield compared to less biodiverse stock‐complexes. These trade‐offs were ameliorated by increasing management control—the capacity of fishery managers to harvest specific stocks. To explore these trade‐offs in real‐world fisheries, we contrasted the fishing and population status of individual stocks within three major mixed‐stock sockeye salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka , Salmonidae) fisheries—Bristol Bay, Fraser River, and Skeena River. In general, the fisheries with lower management control had individual stocks that were more often being over‐ or under‐fished, compared with those with higher management control, though variation among regions in biodiversity, scale of management, and magnitude of habitat alteration likely also contribute to these relationships. Collectively, our findings emphasize that there is a need to extract less or regulate better in order to conserve and benefit from biodiversity in fisheries and other natural resource management systems.},

abstract = {Growth, annual exploitation (u), and natural mortality (v) of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and redear sunfish L. microlophus were investigated on Lake Panasoffkee, Florida, during 1998 and 1999 to assess the potential benefits of several minimum size limits. The average u of 15.0-cm total length (TL) or larger fish was 0.14 for bluegills and redear sunfish during the 2-year period. For both species, exploitation increased up to threefold as fish size increased (e.g., u = 0.37 for bluegills ≥23.0 cm TL in 1999). Total annual mortality (A) was 0.64 for bluegills and 0.68 for redear sunfish. Natural mortality estimates were 0.50 (78% of A) for bluegills and 0.55 (81% of A) for redear sunfish. Simulations predicted that minimum size limits would decrease average total yield and harvest for both bluegills and redear sunfish, but that a 20.3-cm minimum length limit could slightly increase the number of fish harvested over 20.0 cm TL. A 22.9-cm minimum length limit was predicted to greatly reduce yield without creating a measurable increase in the harvest of fish over the size limit. Lake Panasoffkee sunfishes incurred record levels of estimated effort and harvest in 1998-1999, but size-selective exploitation acted essentially as a minimum size limit, resulting in no predicted benefit for a 20.3-cm limit. Separation of fishing mortality and natural mortality allowed us to conclude that natural mortality had a greater influence on Lake Panasoffkee sunfish population abundance and fishing quality than did fishing mortality, so a minimum size limit was not recommended. Estimates of exploitation, natural mortality, and growth rates are more valuable than measures of size structure and angler catch when considering or evaluating harvest restrictions. {\textcopyright} Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2006.},

abstract = {Movements of wide-ranging top predators can now be studied effectively using satellite and archival telemetry. However, the motivations underlying movements remain difficult to determine because trajectories are seldom related to key biological gradients, such as changing prey distributions. Here, we use a dynamic prey landscape of zooplankton biomass in the north-east Atlantic Ocean to examine active habitat selection in the plankton-feeding basking shark Cetorhinus maximus. The relative success of shark searches across this landscape was examined by comparing prey biomass encountered by sharks with encounters by random-walk simulations of 'model' sharks. Movements of transmitter-tagged sharks monitored for 964 days (16754 km estimated minimum distance) were concentrated on the European continental shelf in areas characterized by high seasonal productivity and complex prey distributions. We show movements by adult and sub-adult sharks yielded consistently higher prey encounter rates than 90% of random-walk simulations. Behavioural patterns were consistent with basking sharks using search tactics structured across multiple scales to exploit the richest prey areas available in preferred habitats. Simple behavioural rules based on learned responses to previously encountered prey distributions may explain the high performances. This study highlights how dynamic prey landscapes enable active habitat selection in large predators to be investigated from a trophic perspective, an approach that may inform conservation by identifying critical habitat of vulnerable species.},

abstract = {1.Conservation goals are ideally set after a thorough understanding of potential threats; however, predicting future spatial patterns of threats, such as disturbance, remains challenging. Here, we develop a novel extension of network fortification-interdiction models (NFIM) that deals with uncertainty in future spatial patterns of disturbance by optimally selecting sites that will best mitigate a worst-case scenario for a given magnitude of disturbance.2.This approach uses information on between-patch movement probabilities and patch-specific survival, which can be estimated from mark-recapture data, to optimize life expectancy. Optimization occurs in three interrelated stages: protection, followed by disturbance, and then assessment.3.We applied the modeling approach to two mark-recapture data sets: Roseate terns Sterna dougallii in the northeastern United States and the Everglade snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus in Florida. We contrasted the results to a more conventional approach of protecting sites that maximize connectivity (by minimizing the distances among protected sites) and a bi-objective model that maximizes connectivity and the number of individuals under protection.4.Protecting sites that best mitigate future worst-case disturbance scenarios consistently resulted in higher predicted life expectancies than protecting patches that minimize dispersal distance. Predicted life expectancy was similar between NFIM and the biobjective model for the small roseate tern network, yet, the NFIM predicted higher life expectancy than any of the scenarios in the bi-objective model in the snail kite network.5.Synthesis and applications. This application of interdiction models prescribed a combination of patches for protection that results in the least possible decrease in life expectancy. Our analyses of the snail kite and roseate tern networks suggest that managing to protect these prescribed patches by the network fortification interdiction model (i.e. protecting against the worst-case disturbance scenario) is more beneficial than managing patches that minimize dispersal distance or maximize the number of individuals under protection if the conservation goal is to ensure the long term persistence of a species.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {There is now a large literature on ecosystem-based management (EBM; also known as the ecosystem approach). Our sense is that EBM is moving - albeit slowly - from the "what's, why's and when's" to the "how's" of operationalization and implementation; as such it seemed timely to develop this article theme set (TS). Our objectives were to ascertain the state of the discipline and to advance EBM by offering practical examples of its implementation - or attempts at such - in a variety of incarnations and at various scales, including what has or has not worked, suggestions for best practice, and lessons learned. As exemplified by the articles in this TS, key lessons learned include the need for: constant and clear communication with all parties involved; clear objectives and governance; the distillation of complex ecosystem information into digestible indicators; the establishment of reference levels on which management decisions can be made; and clear protocols to evaluate tradeoffs. Instances of truly multisectoral EBM remain rare, with EBM having advanced farthest within specific ocean-use sectors. Although progress towards implementing operational EBM has been somewhat limited, and although EBM is by its very nature complex and difficult to operationalize, there has been progress nonetheless. We hope that this TS will encourage even further operationalization of EBM.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 922-932 ABSTRACT: Many studies in recent years have investigated the relationship between landscape complexity and pests, natural enemies and/or pest control. However, no quantitative synthesis of this literature beyond simple vote-count methods yet exists. We conducted a meta-analysis of 46 landscape-level studies, and found that natural enemies have a strong positive response to landscape complexity. Generalist enemies show consistent positive responses to landscape complexity across all scales measured, while specialist enemies respond more strongly to landscape complexity at smaller scales. Generalist enemy response to natural habitat also tends to occur at larger spatial scales than for specialist enemies, suggesting that land management strategies to enhance natural pest control should differ depending on whether the dominant enemies are generalists or specialists. The positive response of natural enemies does not necessarily translate into pest control, since pest abundances show no significant response to landscape complexity. Very few landscape-scale studies have estimated enemy impact on pest populations, however, limiting our understanding of the effects of landscape on pest control. We suggest focusing future research efforts on measuring population dynamics rather than static counts to better characterise the relationship between landscape complexity and pest control services from natural enemies.},

A key tool in the application of SCM is the use of casual diagrams, used to visualize the causal structure of a system or process under study. Here, we show how causal diagrams can be extended to ensure proper study design under quasi-experimental settings, including propensity score analysis, before-after-control-impact studies, regression discontinuity design, and instrumental variables. Causal diagrams represent a unified approach to variable selection across methodologies and should be routinely applied in ecology research with causal implications.},

A prior distribution of Z based on literature serves to overcome the biologically implausible Z estimates that can result from frequentist approaches. In addition to the classical estimation of a single P

The use of LEDs is energetically far more efficient than the use of halogen lights equipped with IR filters, and therefore allows automatic long-term video recording at low cost. Laboratory testing of one LED spot at increasing humic acid concentrations indicates that this system can be used for short-range underwater observation in colored lakes. We applied this system to the study of scavenger/carcass interactions. Under field conditions, the setup is not easily detected by animals and allows direct and continuous observation of animal interactions during a full daily cycle. Note that, to our knowledge, this video system provides the first published night movies of freshwater fish behavior filmed in highly colored lakes, without using visible light. Our results indicate that this nonintrusive system can be successfully used for scientific studies in freshwater ecology, even in the presence of significant concentrations of light-absorbing humic substances in the water.},

Harvest has the potential to cause three types of genetic change: alteration of population subdivision, loss of genetic variation, and selective genetic changes. To sustain the productivity of harvested populations, it is crucial to incorporate genetic considerations into management. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to disentangle genetic and environmental causes of phenotypic changes to develop management plans for individual species. We recommend recognizing that some genetic change due to harvest is inevitable. Management plans should be developed by applying basic genetic principles combined with molecular genetic monitoring to minimize harmful genetic change.},

abstract = {Catch-curve analysis is one of the simplestmethods for stock assessment andis widely applied indata-poor fisheries. Conventional catch-curve methods rely on the strong assumptions of constant fishing and natural mortality rates above some fully selected age that is usually estimated by visually inspecting a plot of catch at age. Here, we evaluate the performance of three catch-curve methods that relax or modify these assumptions by (1) estimating logistic selectivity parameters, (2) assuming Lorenzen-form natural mortality (naturalmortality that decreases with weight), and (3) using bothmethods simultaneously.We used simulationmodeling and decision tables to compare estimates of fishing mortality from four catch-curve methods, including the conventional method, across a variety of observable and unobservable data characteristics. We then applied the methods to catch-at-age data for Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus from the U.S. South Atlantic fishery management region and compared the resulting estimates with published estimates of fishing mortality (F). In our simulation modeling, catch curves that estimated logistic selectivity parameters performed better than those derived by the conventional method when logistic selectivity was present. There was generally little difference in performance between estimates assuming constant natural mortality and those assuming Lorenzen naturalmortality. The improvements fromestimating selectivity parameters were particularly pronounced when the sample sizes for catch-at-age data were large: in those instances, estimating selectivity improved the estimation accuracy for F by nearly 20%. In our example involving Atlantic menhaden, estimates of F assuming logistic selectivity were most similar to those of published stock assessments, which had previously estimated logistic selectivity at age.We recommend our logistic-selectivity catch curve when selectivity is likely to be logistic because it improves accuracy at only a very small cost in terms of computational complexity.

Poor environmental management can lead to reduced ecological resilience and social–ecological collapse. We review research on resilience and collapse across different systems and propose a unifying social–ecological framework based on (i) a clear definition of system identity; (ii) the use of quantitative thresholds to define collapse; (iii) relating collapse processes to system structure; and (iv) explicit comparison of alternative hypotheses and models of collapse. Analysis of 17 representative cases identified 14 mechanisms, in five classes, that explain social–ecological collapse. System structure influences the kind of collapse a system may experience. Mechanistic theories of collapse that unite structure and process can make fundamental contributions to solving global environmental problems. As social–ecological systems enter a period of rapid global change, science must predict and explain ‘unthinkable' social, ecological, and social–ecological collapses. Existing theories of collapse are weakly integrated with resilience theory and ideas about vulnerability and sustainability. Mechanisms of collapse are poorly understood and often heavily contested. Progress in understanding collapse requires greater clarity on system identity and alternative causes of collapse. Archaeological theories have focused on a limited range of reasons for system collapse. In resilience theory, the adaptive cycle has been used to describe collapse but offers little insight into the mechanisms that cause it. Theories of collapse should connect structure and process. Mechanistic, structure–process–function theories of collapse suggest new avenues for understanding and improving resilience.},

The <i>per capita</i> recruitment rate was almost two times higher in source-sink than in the source-source system, but this did not compensate for the loss rate due to dispersal from source to sink patches. Sex ratio in the source-sink systems became less female biased, probably a result of an enhanced frequency of dispersal movements in femals.

Invasion of littoral zones by adventive macrophyte species can facilitate major changes in the ecology of lakes. In Lake Wanaka, a large alpine New Zealand lake, the macrophytes Lagaro-siphon major and Elodea canadensis (Hydrocharitaceae) have invaded parts of the lake where they form tall dense plant beds throughout mid-depths (2–7 m) of the littoral zone. We investigated differences in plants, benthic invertebrates, fish, and food webs characterizing native and exotic plant beds in mid-depths of the littoral zone. The 3ϫ higher plant biomass and 2ϫ higher plant surface area in exotic than in native plant beds (quillworts, milfoils, and charophytes) contributed to greater standing stocks and productivity of epiphyton in the exotic plant beds. Invertebrate communities were less dense (1890/m 2 vs 4030/m 2) and less diverse (richness ϭ 9 vs 12) in native than in exotic plant beds because of differences in biomass, productivity, and physical structure of native and exotic plant communities. Invertebrate communities in native beds were dominated by snails, oligochaetes, and nematodes, whereas chironomids, snails, and caddisflies were dominant in exotic beds. Stable isotope signatures (13 C and 15 N) and dietary analyses indicated that Potamopyrgus antipodarum, the dominant invertebrate taxon in both bed types, consumed mostly epiphyton. In native beds, consumption of sedimentary fine benthic organic matter by oligochaetes and nematodes made significant contribu-tions to C flow, whereas, in exotic beds, consumption of epiphyton by grazers (e.g., snails, caddisflies, and chironomids) was an important pathway for C flow. Macrophytes made only small contributions to C flow in either bed type. The dominant native fish in Lake Wanaka, the bully Gobiomorphus cotidianus, was more abundant in exotic than in native beds, but bully predation rates on snails were significantly lower in exotic than in native beds. Invasion by adventive macrophyte species can cause significant shifts in lake productivity, species composition, and foodweb dynamics.},

abstract = {A stochastic model is developed to analyze the equilibrium spatial pattern of population synchrony, the correlation of temporal fluctuations in population density between localities. The expected population dynamics and the distribution of individual dispersal distance are homogeneous in space. Environmental stochasticity is caused by temporal fluctuations in the intrinsic rate of increase and/or carrying capacity of local populations that are correlated in space (but not time), the environmental correlation decreasing with distance. We analyze a linearized model for small fluctuations. Employing the standard deviation of a function in a given direction as a measure of scale, the spatial scale of population synchrony, lrho, is related to the spatial scales of environmental correlation, le, and individual dispersal, l, by the simple general formula l2rho=l2e+ml2&solm0;gamma, where m is the individual dispersal rate and gamma is the strength of population density regulation (or rate of return to equilibrium, r&d1; in the logistic model). Relative to environmental correlation (the Moran effect), the contribution of individual dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony is magnified by the ratio of the individual dispersal rate to the strength of density regulation. Thus, even if the scale of individual dispersal is smaller than that of environmental correlation, dispersal can substantially increase the scale of population synchrony for weakly regulated populations.},

abstract = {Evolutionary effects of fishing can have unwanted consequences diminishing a fishery's value and sustainability. Reserves, or no-take areas, have been proposed as a management tool for reducing fisheries-induced selection, but their effectiveness for migratory species has remained unexplored. Here we develop an eco-genetic model to predict the effects of marine reserves on fisheries-induced evolution under migration. To represent a stock that undergoes an annual migration between feeding and spawning grounds, we draw model parameters from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern part of its range. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) a reserve in a stock's feeding grounds, protecting immature and mature fish alike, reduces fisheries-induced evolution, even though protected and unprotected population components mix on the spawning grounds; (ii) in contrast, a reserve in a stock's spawning grounds, protecting only mature fish, has little mitigating effects on fisheries-induced evolution and can sometimes even exacerbate its magnitude; (iii) evolutionary changes that are already underway may be difficult to reverse with a reserve; (iv) directly after a reserve is created or enlarged, most reserve scenarios result in yield losses; and (v) timescale is very important: short-term yield losses immediately after a reserve's creation can give way to long-term gains. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {An important problem for conservation of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii is the presence of nonnative trout. We used eight 20-m instream enclosures on the Rio Cebolla, New Mexico, to evaluate competition between hatchery-raised Rio Grande cutthroat trout O. clarkii virginalis and similar-sized wild, nonnative brown trout Salmo trutta. Four control enclosures each contained 20 fish of the same species; four treatment enclosures each contained equal numbers of like-sized fish of the two species. Results indicated that wild brown trout were superior competitors to hatchery-raised Rio Grande cutthroat trout. Significant interspecific, competition was inferred from comparisons of treatment fish with their controls. Among Rio Grande cutthroat trout, control fish grew in length and body weight, whereas growth of fish confined in enclosures with brown trout was significantly lower than that ofcontrols (P < 0.001). In contrast, brown trout enclosed with Rio Grande cutthroat trout experienced significantly greater growth than did control brown trout (P < 0.005). Rio Grande cutthroat trout in enclosures with brown trout had lower postmortem fat content and an elevated incidence of caudal fin damage than did control fish. Gut contents showed that control fish of both species fed most frequently on small larval caddistlies Lepidostoma spp. However, when the two species were confined together, more brown trout had food in the gut and the food items consumed by Rio Grande cutthroat trout shifted from Lepidostoma spp. to surface-occurring invertebrates (terrestrial infall, water striders, water mites, and phaerate adult aquatic insects) and benthic-associated invertebrates (oligochaetes, caddisflies [Limnephilidae and Helicopsyche spp.], and snails). Collectively, the results indicated interspecific competition that was mediated through elevated aggression by brown trout that altered foraging activity by both species. The results underscore the importance of minimizing contact with normative brown trout when using hatchery fish to restore cutthroat trout to suitable habitats.},

The three watersheds all lie on Vancouver Island; however, they have different precipitation regimes, topography, and amounts logged. Landslide areas in the watersheds varied in size from 200 m2 to more than 1 ha. Nearly 80% of the landslides were debris slides; 15% were debris flows, and the remainder primarily rock falls. Following logging, the number of landslides increased substantially in all watersheds although the amount of increase was variable: approximately 11, 3, and 16 times in Macktush Creek, Artilish River, and Nahwitti River, respectively. Other analyses of changes in landslide density also produced highly variable results, with the number of landslides increasing between 2.4 and 24 times. Further, 2-12 times more landslides reached streams following logging activities. Densities for landslides impacting streams increased for the period of record from 1.5 to 10 times following logging activities. The densities were substantially greater where only landslides that reached streams since development began in a watershed were considered. Roads had the greatest spatial impact in the watersheds (compared to their total area), with frequencies determined to have increased by 27, 12, and 94 times for Macktush, Artlish, and Nahwitti, respectively. The results highlight the relative impact of roads and their role in slope stability. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An important question for salmon restoration efforts in the western USA is 'How should habitat restoration plans be altered to accommodate climate change effects on stream flow and temperature?' We developed a decision support process for adapting salmon recovery plans that incorporates (1) local habitat factors limiting salmon recovery, (2) scenarios of climate change effects on stream flow and temperature, (3) the ability of restoration actions to ameliorate climate change effects, and (4) the ability of restoration actions to increase habitat diversity and salmon population resilience. To facilitate the use of this decision support framework, we mapped scenarios of future stream flow and temperature in the Pacific Northwest region and reviewed literature on habitat restoration actions to determine whether they ameliorate a climate change effect or increase life history diversity and salmon resilience. Under the climate change scenarios considered here, summer low flows decrease by 35-75% west of the Cascade Mountains, maximum monthly flows increase by 10-60% across most of the region, and stream temperatures increase between 2 and 6°C by 2070-2099. On the basis of our literature review, we found that restoring floodplain connectivity, restoring stream flow regimes, and re-aggrading incised channels are most likely to ameliorate stream flow and temperature changes and increase habitat diversity and population resilience. By contrast, most restoration actions focused on in-stream rehabilitation are unlikely to ameliorate climate change effects. Finally, we illustrate how the decision support process can be used to evaluate whether climate change should alter the types or priority of restoration actions in a salmon habitat restoration plan. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {We argue that globalization is a central feature of coupled human-environment systems or, as we call them, socio-ecological systems (SESs). In this article, we focus on the effects of globalization on the resilience, vulnerability, and adaptability of these systems. We begin with a brief discussion of key terms, arguing that socio-economic resilience regularly substitutes for biophysical resilience in SESs with consequences that are often unforeseen. A discussion of several mega-trends (e.g. the rise of mega-cities, the demand for hydrocarbons, the revolution in information technologies) underpins our argument. We then proceed to identify key analytical dimensions of globalization, including rising connectedness, increased speed, spatial stretching, and declining diversity. We show how each of these phenomena can cut both ways in terms of impacts on the resilience and vulnerability of SESs. A particularly important insight flowing from this analysis centers on the reversal of the usual conditions in which large-scale things are slow and durable while small-scale things are fast and ephemeral. The fact that SESs are reflexive can lead either to initiatives aimed at avoiding or mitigating the dangers of globalization or to positive feedback processes that intensify the impacts of globalization. In the concluding section, we argue for sustained empirical research regarding these concerns and make suggestions about ways to enhance the incentives for individual researchers to work on these matters. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite decades of progress, watershed planning for the East Slopes of Alberta is still in its infancy. This is a busy landscape that continues to get busier with a growing population demanding more from resource extraction, recreation and water supplies. Meshing these demands with a landscape which forms an essential water source for downstream water users, unique biodiversity attributes, wild space and stunning scenery is a task requiring more than maintaining the status quo. What Albertans draw from the East Slopes is substantial-economically, ecologically, socially and personally. Yet, the rate of reinvestment isn't proportional to the take and the signals of overuse are evident. Native trout declines are a message hard to ignore. Their plight is a signal that many of the values Albertans hold for the East Slopes are at risk. In some cases, like flooding, our land use decisions pose a risk to downstream communities. The East Slopes do not represent an inexhaustible supply of benefits for Albertans. We need to set ecologically relevant limits and thresholds; without them we continue to spiral towards overuse. Investments need to be considered for restoration, especially where limits have been exceeded. Research needs, like better measurements of water quantity and quality, biodiversity and the effects of climate change require adequate resources. At the centre is understanding and untangling the additive effects of every want and desire for the East Slopes. First, we have to understand where we are, compare that to where we were (the historical benchmark) and assess whether our land use trajectory will take us to a desirable future. Implicit in this is the sense we do not want to sacrifice attributes of the East Slopes in our present decisions that will have future, perhaps irreversible consequences. Past cumulative effects exercises show the status quo approach (continuing to maintain land use pressures) is not favourable for future circumstances. Recognizing that, then a set of alternatives need to be posed and tested. That is the essence of this exercise of Cumulative Effects of Land Uses and Conservation Priorities in Alberta's Southern East Slope Watersheds. How we move forward in the East Slopes is a test-a test of our ability to be good stewards of an essential Alberta landscape.},

abstract = {Habitat assessments are often based on the premise that spatial variation in population density arises from, and accurately reflects, underlying differences in quality among habitats. Nonetheless, this premise has been criticized on both theoretical and empirical grounds. Habitat quality perhaps is best evaluated by examining behavioural processes which directly influence habitat use.We present an approach based on the assumption that measures of local movement, such as habitat-specific immigration and loss rates, provide useful indicators of habitat quality. A dynamic turnover model was used in conjunction with mark-recapture techniques to estimate movement param- eters for brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in different stream habitats during the summer. Immigration and loss rates were derived from mark-recapture experiments covering short periods of time (6 days). Movement-based rankings of habitat quality for both charr (pools ≥ glides > riffles) and salmon (riffles > glides > pools) were in agreement with results from earlier studies. Over evaluation periods of up to 65 days, observed abundances were highly variable in time and fluctuated about the equilibrium abundances calculated from movement parameters in the short-term experiments, suggesting that movement-based parameters may be more stable than measures of abundance for evaluating salmonid habitat. Because the approach based on movement behaviour focuses on immigration and loss, two processes that directly generate density differentials between habi- tats, it provides a more reliable mechanistic basis for understanding habitat selection than do traditional approaches based on density–quality relationships.},

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ?functional landscape heterogeneity?. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Keywords},

We have compiled such a data set by georeferencing the network-scale distribution of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) redds across a large wilderness basin (7330 km2) in central Idaho for 9 years (1995–2003). During this time, the population grew at a rate of 5.3 recruits per spawner, and redd numbers increased from 20 to 2271. As abundances increased, fish expanded into portions of the stream network that had recently been unoccupied. Even at the highest escapements, however, distributions remained clustered, and a limited portion of the network contained the majority of redds. The importance of the highest density spawning areas was greatest when abundances were low, suggesting these areas may serve as refugia during demo- graphic bottlenecks. Analysis of variance indicated that redd numbers were strongly affected by local habitats and broad climatic controls, but also revealed a space–time interaction that suggested temporal instability in spatial patterns. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining habitats with high densities of individuals, but also suggest that broader views may be needed to accommodate the dynamics of natural salmonid populations.

Simulation modelling as a tool for examining the consequences of spatial structure and connectivity on local and regional population dynamics. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1631–1639.\nAn understanding of the mechanisms underlying population persistence makes fisheries management more effective. A model framework is described, which can test hypotheses about spatial structure and connectivity within and between populations and their influence on the productivity (spawning-stock biomass, SSB), stability (variation in SSB), resilience (time to rebuild SSB after environmental disturbance), and sustainability (maximum sustainable fishing mortality and yield) of systems. The general model consists of linked age-structured submodels that incorporate the unique demographics and dynamics of population components, along with the degree and type of connectivity between them. The flexibility of this framework is illustrated with three case studies examining (i) spatial structure within a population of white perch, (ii) different types and degrees of connectivity between populations of Atlantic herring, and (iii) spatial heterogeneity and connectivity within a stock of Atlantic cod. System variance is reduced by abundant, stable population components, and the asynchronous responses of those components. Components with high productivity contributed disproportionately to the resilience of systems. Increased synchrony of component responses to environmental forcing decreased the stability of the overall system. Simulation modelling is a useful approach to evaluate the consequences of spatial structure and connectivity, and can be used to understand better the productivity and dynamics of local and regional populations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society Several new growth models have been proposed to account for the life-history trade-offs that occur when indeterminately growing species allocate energy between somatic growth and reproduction. These models can improve the understanding of lifetime growth and life history, but can be more difficult to fit than conventional growth models. Increased data demands, multiple growth phases and increased parameterization all serve as barriers to the adoption and proper use of these new models. We review and comment on confounding issues during model fitting for several of these models, and provide advice on surmounting such issues. We then simulation-test an example model, the Lester biphasic growth model, using several common fitting approaches. We highlight the biases and precision of each approach and provide guiding documents using r and jags code. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and likelihood profiling approaches generally provided the best fits. Simpler approaches can be unbiased and precise if sampled data are of relatively high quality (e.g. moderate sample sizes for juvenile and adult phases) and model assumptions are met. Bayesian hierarchical approaches can accommodate more complicated data scenarios (e.g. unbalanced design across multiple populations); we provide an example of such an approach by recovering growth trajectories and inferring growth-associated trait variation and environmental effects across multiple populations. Conventional growth models provide limited inference on life history. Many biphasic growth models can provide direct inference on multiple life-history traits, but can be difficult to fit. The recommended approaches herein provide a path forward for fitting biphasic growth models in a variety of scenarios, allowing for wider application and tests of life history and ecological theory.},

abstract = {This issue addresses the multifaceted problems of understanding biodiversity change to meet emerging international development and conservation goals, national economic accounting and diverse community needs. Recent international agreements highlight the need to establish monitoring and assessment programmes at national and regional levels. We identify an opportunity for the research community to develop the methods for robust detection and attribution of biodiversity change that will contribute to national assessments and guide conservation action. The 16 contributions of this issue address six major aspects of biodiversity assessment: connecting policy to science, establishing observation, improving statistical estimation, detecting change, attributing causes and projecting the future. These studies are led by experts in Indigenous studies, economics, ecology, conservation, statistics, and computer science, with representations from Asia, Africa, South America, North America and Europe. The results place biodiversity science in the context of policy needs and provide an updated roadmap for how to observe biodiversity change in a way that supports conservation action via robust detection and attribution science.

abstract = { Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to interpret and map fish distributions based on habitat variables and other drivers. Reef fish avoidance behavior has been shown to vary in the presence of divers and is primarily driven by spearfishing pressure. Diver avoidance behavior or fish wariness may spatially influence counts and other descriptive measures of fish assemblages. Because fish assemblage metrics are response variables for SDMs, measures of fish wariness may be useful as predictors in SDMs of fishes targeted by spearfishing. We used a diver operated stereo-video system to conduct fish surveys and record minimum approach distance (MAD) of targeted reef fishes inside and outside of two marine reserves on the island of Oʻahu in the main Hawaiian Islands. By comparing MAD between sites and management types we tested the assumption that it provides a proxy for fish wariness related to spearfishing pressure. We then compared the accuracy of SDMs which included MAD as a predictor with SDMs that did not. Individual measures of MAD differed between sites though not management types. When included as a predictor, MAD averaged at the transect level greatly improved the accuracy of SDMs of targeted fish biomass. },

abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) below near-surface optimums in the eastern tropical seas are among the largest contiguous areas of naturally occurring hypoxia in the world oceans, and are predicted to expand and shoal with global warming. In the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), the surface mixed layer is defined by a shallow thermocline above a barrier of cold hypoxic water, where dissolved oxygen levels are ≤3.5 mL L-1. This thermocline ($\sim$25-50 m) constitutes a lower hypoxic habitat boundary for high oxygen demand tropical pelagic billfish and tunas (i.e., habitat compression). To evaluate similar oceanographic conditions found in the eastern tropical Atlantic (ETA), we compared vertical habitat use of 32 sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) and 47 blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) monitored with pop-up satellite archival tags in the ETA and western North Atlantic (WNA). Both species spent significantly greater proportions of their time in near-surface waters when inside the ETA than when in the WNA. We contend that the near-surface density of billfish and tunas increases as a consequence of the ETA OMZ, therefore increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation by surface gears. Because the ETA OMZ encompasses nearly all Atlantic equatorial waters, the potential impacts of overexploitation are a concern. Considering the obvious differences in catchability inside and outside the compression zones, it seems essential to standardize these catch rates separately to minimize inaccuracies in stock assessments for these species. This is especially true in light of global warming, which will likely exacerbate future compression impacts. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

Distinct Indigenous worldviews and complex knowledge systems have been passed on from generation to generation, evolving over time in a living process that continues to this day. Indigenous Peoples' knowledge systems hold methodologies and assessment processes that provide pathways for knowing and understanding the Arctic, which address all aspects of life, including the spiritual, cultural, and ecological, all in interlinked and supporting ways. For too long, Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and their knowledges have not been equitably included in many research activities. We argue for systematic change in how research-related activities are conducted in the Arctic. Bringing together multiple knowledge systems, specifically Indigenous Peoples' knowledge systems and science, can lead to more equitable, inclusive, and useful outcomes. The co-production of knowledge framework that we forward is designed to assist researchers, decision makers, and communities in moving toward those goals. Given increased interest in the Arctic by the research community, the complex, rapid, and ongoing change in Arctic systems, and amidst renewed and urgent calls for equity globally and across all spheres of life, adoption of a co-production of knowledge framework for the conduct of Arctic research is timely as well as a moral and intellectual imperative.

We detected no evidence of hyperstability in the experimental fishery, but significant hyperstability in the open-access fishery.

Abundance was approximately one order of magnitude higher during the mid-1980s than in 1990-2004. Growth rates were negatively related to relative abundance and were sexually dimorphic (females grew faster than males). Regression analysis indicated that approximately one-half of the observed variation in growth was related to abundance; this was most apparent with smaller and younger fish. Lee's phenomenon was shown to be present during periods of high exploitation and not present during periods of low exploitation.

abstract = {Movement is important for ecological and evolutionary theory as well as connectivity conservation, which is increasingly critical for species responding to environmental change. Key ecological and evolutionary outcomes of movement, such as population growth and gene flow, require effective dispersal: movement that is followed by successful reproduction. However, the relative roles of movement and postmovement reproduction for effective dispersal and connectivity remain unclear. Here we isolate the contributions of movement and immigrant reproduction to effective dispersal and connectivity across the entire breeding range of an endangered raptor, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). To do so, we unite mark-resight data on movement and reproduction across 9 years and 27 breeding patches with an integrated model that decomposes effective dispersal into its hierarchical levels of movement, postmovement breeding attempt, and postmovement reproductive success. We found that immigrant reproduction limits effective dispersal more than movement for this endangered species, demonstrating that even highly mobile species may have limited effective connectivity due to reduced immigrant reproduction. We found different environmental limitations for the reproductive component of effective dispersal compared with movement, indicating that different conservation strategies may be needed when promoting effective dispersal rather than movement alone. We also demonstrate that considering immigrant reproduction, rather than movement alone, alters which patches are the most essential for connectivity, thereby changing conservation priorities. These results challenge the assumption that understanding movement alone is sufficient to infer connectivity and highlight that connectivity conservation may require not only fostering movement but also successful reproduction of immigrants.},

However, few empirical MPA evaluation studies have used consistent sampling methodology across multiple MPAs and years. Our collaborative fisheries research program systematically sampled 12 no-take or highly protective limited-take MPAs and paired fished reference areas across a network spanning 1100 km of coastline to evaluate the factors driving MPA efficacy across a large geographic region. We found that increased size and age consistently contributed to increased fish catch, biomass, and positive species responses inside MPAs, while accounting for factors such as latitude, primary productivity, and distance to the nearest MPA.

abstract = {Knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary causes of dispersal can be crucial in understanding the behaviour of spatially structured populations, and predicting how species respond to environmental change. Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term ‚{\"{A}}{\`{o}}dispersal‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}, for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.},

abstract = {In marine populations, spatial structure arises over a wide range of scales and forms hierarchical aggregations. Changing spatial structure can alter the demographic and life history trait variation within populations and subject individuals to both novel environmental conditions and interspecific interactions. Thus, changes in the spatial structure of marine populations can be a prelude to further changes in abundance and can affect the resilience and recovery potential of populations following anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. These observations under - score the importance of studying the spatial ecology of marine fish populations in order to (1) understand the underlying mechanisms that can lead to rapid alterations in population abundance and community interactions, (2) provide indicators of stock health, and (3) characterize the consequences of changing spatial patterns on population susceptibility to exploitation and environmental variability. Here, we synthesize the interacting factors that influence the formation, maintenance and erosion of spatial structure in marine fish populations and identify the further con sequences of such erosion at the population and community levels. We emphasize human driven changes of population spatial structure for 3 levels of population genetic aggregation that are common in fisheries management scenarios, namely sympatric populations, metapopulations and panmictic populations. Case studies are presented for each level of aggregation. Throughout our review, we both summarize the factors that link spatial and temporal dynamics in marine populations and highlight the management and conservation implications of such linkages. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract = {Population sustainability of walleyes Sander vitreus in the face of angling and spearing fisheries has been a concern of fishery managers in northern Wisconsin since off-reservation tribal fishing rights were affirmed by federal court decisions. We evaluated sustainability of walleye populations across a range of densities that were subjected to various exploitation rates and allocations of angling and spearing harvest (the fisheries differ in size selectivity). We developed an age-structured population model for estimating extinction risk and time to extinction for a hypothetical walleye population at a specified exploitation rate, fishery allocation, and initial density. The model was parameterized from data obtained during surveys of walleye populations in northern Wisconsin lakes. Simulations covered a range of annual exploitation rates that included the currently accepted rate of 35% and a range of population densities that are presently included in regression models relating walleye abundance to lake surface area. ne risk of extinction began to increase above zero at exploitation rates of 61-65% for an unregulated angling fishery, 85-86% for an angling fishery with a 15-in minimum length limit, and 77-78% for a spearing fishery. The probability of decline began to increase above zero at exploitation rates of 61-65% for an unregulated angling fishery, 84-85% for an angling fishery with a 15-in minimum length limit, and 72-77% for a spearing fishery. As the exploitation rate increased, the average adult density decreased and the time to extinction decreased for all initial population densities. We conclude that the current maximum exploitation rate of 35% may be sustainable for all initial Population densities but that a controlled field experiment should be used to verify our modeling results before any changes to angling bag limits or spearing quotas are made.},

Considering the importance of this reaction for future energy technologies, it is understandable that the enzyme as well as synthetic analogues of its active site are subject of great interest. Our interest in synthetic models of the iron hydrogenase active site is manifold. We are mimicking certain features of the enzyme active site (Chem. Commun., 2006, 4206), and study the mechanism of hydrogen formation (Chem. Commun., 2006, 520). Our research on isolated and well defined synthetic models thereby contributes to the understanding of the enzyme's function. We then intend to exploit this knowledge and develop improved synthetic catalysts (Angew. Chem. IEE, 2004, 1006).

abstract = {For organisms with restricted mobility, density dependence may occur on spatial scales much smaller than that of the whole population. Averaging densities over whole populations in such organisms gives a more or less inaccurate description of the real variation in competitive intensity over time and space. The potential for local density dependence in more mobile organisms is less well understood, particularly for organisms living in continuous habitats. To test for local density-dependent processes in such an organism, we manipulated egg density (the number of eggs nest(-1)) among ten artificial nests of Atlantic salmon along an 1,848-m long river during two consecutive years. Eggs in different nests were given unique thermal otolith-banding patterns to allow identification of juvenile nest origin. At capture, 1-2 months after emergence, the spatial distribution of juveniles reflected nest locations, with the median absolute dispersal distance being 92 and 41 m in the 2 years. Estimated nest-specific survival rates were strongly negatively related to hatched-egg density in both years (r(2)=0.72 and 0.62), despite dramatic differences in overall mean survival (0.22 and 0.02). Thus, density-dependent survival following emergence in Atlantic salmon juveniles occurs on spatial scales much smaller than that of whole populations. The consistency across years suggests that the phenomenon is likely to occur over most environmental conditions. Our observation of local-scale density dependence is consistent with strong juvenile territoriality, which forces individuals emerging in high-initial density areas to disperse farther, and a high cost (metabolic or predation) of dispersal. We conclude that for mobile organisms with patchy distributions of propagules and constrained juvenile dispersal, increased emphasis on local-scale dynamics should enable a more mechanistic understanding of population regulation even in continuous habitats, and hence increase the predictive power of population models.},

These events and their consequences - including the loss of ecosystem services - may be predictable or may occur without warning. Given these considerations, greater efforts are needed in two areas of research: improvements in early warning capability and advances in the management of ecosystems to enhance resilience. Current research has provided enhanced forecasting ability, scenario analysis, and detection of statistical anomalies that indicate abrupt change, but two key concerns remain: the detection of early warning signs near thresholds of change and the use of such warnings for ecosystem management. Furthermore, there may be no advance warning for some types of abrupt change, reinforcing the need to enhance resilience by managing ecosystems to reduce the possibility of crossing thresholds of change. Designing and implementing large-scale management programs is one way to confront these problems.},

Tentative generalizations about evolutionary processes across species are beginning to emerge, as well as contrasting patterns that characterize different groups of organisms.

We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries, but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64% of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56%) and fishery yields (8 to 40%).},

The focus was on the linearity or nonlinearity of these abiotic/biotic characteristics, with the aim to obtain an accurate short-medium term time-scale diversity prediction from habitat variables alone. Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR) were used for the linear approach and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the nonlinear approach. MLR results in the external validation phase indicated a lack of model accuracy (R2 = 0.0710; %SEP = 47.5868; E = -0.0217; ARV = 1.0217; N = 43). Results of the best of the Artificial Neural Networks used in this study (12-15-15-1 architecture) in the external validation phase (ANN: R2 = 0.9736; %SEP = 7.8499; E = 0.9722; ARV = 0.0278; N = 43) were more accurate than those obtained with MLR. This indicates a clear nonlinear relationship between variables. In the best ANN model, nitrate concentration, depth, dissolved oxygen and temperature were the most important predictors of fish diversity in the Tagus estuary. The sensibility analysis indicated that the remaining variables (silicate, nitrite, transparency, salinity, slope, phosphate, water particulate organic matter, and chlorophyll a) played lesser roles in the model.},

The model generalizes the Gordon [1954]/Smith [1968] model of open-access rent dissipation by accounting for intertemporal and spatial “Ricardian” patterns of exploitation. This model yields a simple, but insightful, framework from which one can investigate factors that contribute to the evolution of resource exploitation patterns over space and time. For example, we find that exploitation patterns are driven by biological and fleet dispersal and biological and economic heterogeneity.

A biologically sensible age–length structured multispecies Gadget model (incorporating minke whales, cod, herring, and capelin) for the Barents Sea—acting as the operating model—has been linked to Fisheries Library in R—acting as the management procedure—to perform management strategy evaluations. Assessments may be run using either XSA, survey-based methods, or by taking modelled stock numbers directly. Total allowable catches are based on the assessment and harvest control rules (HCRs). The tool can be used for assessing a wide variety of sources of uncertainties within the assessment process. Model structure and linkages are described and a fit to the historical data is presented. A base case of future dynamic (non-steady state) stock trends, based on the existing HCRs, is compared with alternative management and environmental scenarios. The relative differences for each scenario in terms of stock size and catches highlight a number of uncertainties within the biological and fisheries system. The results indicate that the current management rules are robust to the range of scenarios examined so far.},

abstract = {Nearshore habitats play a vital role in the life cycles of many marine fishes. These habitats are particularly important for Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, which rely on submerged vegetation in the shallow subtidal for spawning habitat and egg incubation. However, little is known about spatial or temporal variation in egg success or how spawning habitat may affect herring early life history. We estimated herring egg loss rates across multiple spawning vegetations in 5 subpopulations of Pacific herring in Puget Sound (USA), an urbanized estuarine system. We found enormous variation in herring egg loss among subpopulations (range of daily loss rates: 5 to 70%) and in egg loss of eggs reared under common garden conditions (range of cumulative loss: 20 to 100%). Egg loss varied by subpopulation but not by spawning vegetation type. Exploratory analyses suggest both wave height and land use patterns may affect hatch success. Using historical survey data, we found that a large proportion of spawning habitat available to Puget Sound herring remains unused each year. Furthermore, we found limited evidence that eggs were deposited disproportionally on particular vegetation types; only the non-indigenous brown algae Sargassum muticum was spawned on more than expected by chance. Our results demonstrate that Puget Sound herring are not limited by the amount of available suitable spawning vegetation, and that native vegetation is not preferred over other vegetation types for herring spawning. Rather, it appears that other terrestrial or marine variables are likely determinants of herring egg loss.},

abstract = {Native ungulate species constitute an important source of protein for Mesoamerican subsistence hunters. In this study, we (1) provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that source-sink systems help maintain some of the ungulate populations in the Lacandon Forest, Mexico; and (2) test the assumptions that density, age structure, and sex ratios are different in slightly hunted (potential sources) and persistently hunted (potential sinks) populations. From May 1998 to March 2001 we observed 1144 individuals and 1153 tracks of five ungulate species (Baird's tapir, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, red brocket deer, and white-tailed deer) along 1908 km of line transects in slightly and persistently hunted sites of Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (MABR) and adjacent community lands. Densities of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary were lower in persistently hunted sites, where there were higher proportions of young tapirs and white-tailed deer. The sustainability of hunting was evaluated in five communities using information on harvest rates, production rates, and density of each population. Our results suggest that persistently hunted populations of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary are at risk of local extinction, while collared peccary hunting appears to be sustainable. The red brocket deer, although locally overhunted, maintains a relatively safe status probably through a source-sink system in which MABR functions as the source of individuals which are readily hunted in adjacent community lands. Source-sink systems may be also important in maintaining Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary populations outside protected areas of the Lacandon Forest, from evidence of migration observed during this study. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A habitat enhancement project was conducted from 1995-1996 to remove macrophytes and organic matter from about half of the 80-km shoreline of Lake Kissimmee, Florida. Habitat quality was evaluated in enhanced and control (i. e., debilitated areas left intact after enhancement) areas and largemouth bass density and growth in enhanced sites from 1998-2000.Control sites were characterized by low dissolved oxygen throughout the day (mean < 2 mg/L), high aquatic macrophyte biomass (> 50 kg/m,), and the percent of coverage of aquatic macrophytes (PAC) from 100 percent. Qualitative fish sampling in control sites yielded no sportfishes. Enhanced sites generally had mean DO greater than 4 mg/L, relatively low aquatic macrophyte biomass (mean < 5 kg/m,), and intermediate PAC (5-90%). Mean density of age-0 largemouth bass in enhanced sites averaged about 100 fish/ha from May-August of both years and was positively related to PAC in block nets in 1998.Growth rates of age-0 largemouth bass in 1998 and 1999 were rapid compared to historical records at Lake Kissimmee and a database some records of 56 Florida lakes. Diet analysis of age-0 largemouth bass revealed that fish were important prey (> 30% of diets by weight) from June-March of both years. Early piscivory of age-0 largemouth bass probably resulted in rapid growth rates. The habitat enhancement project created quality habitat for age-0 largemouth bass at Lake Kissimmee, and benefits were prolonged relative to previous enhancement efforts at another lake.},

abstract = {Abstract: Point counts are commonlyu sed to monitorb ird populations,a nd a substantiala mounto f research has investigated how conducting counts for different lengths of time affects the accuracy of these counts and the subsequent ability to monitor changes in population trends. However, little work has been done to assess how changes in count duration affect bird-habitat models developed from point count data. In this paper, we present an empirical comparison of the performance of bird-habitat models, which were developed via logistic regression analyses based on point count data from 3-, 5-, 10-, and 20-min counts. We also investigated the effect of the number of visits to each survey point on model performance. We assessed model performance on the basis of R2-values and percent concordant pairs. A positive relation between model performance and count durationw as most apparentf or species with relativelyl ow detection probabilitiesw, hereasp erformance of models for species with relatively high detectability was fairly consistent or even decreased as count duration increased. Our results suggest that while some improvement in bird-habitat models for species with low detection rates can be achieved via longer point counts, the modest gains in model performance should be weighed against the increased time and effort required to conduct longer counts. Models based on data from a single visit to each point did not performed as well as models based on multiple visits. However, we found little or no improvement in model performance when the number of visits per point increased from 2 to 3. We suggest that current recommendations on point count durations (5 or 10 min) will provide adequate data for modeling bird-habitat relations.

abstract = {Unraveling the relationship between demographic declines and genetic changes over time is of critical importance to predict the persistence of at-risk populations and to propose efficient conservation plans. This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a ‘reservoir' of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context.},

abstract = {The geographic distributions of marine species are changing rapidly, with leading range edges following climate poleward, deeper, and in other directions and trailing range edges often contracting in similar directions. These shifts have their roots in fine-scale interactions between organisms and their environment-including mosaics and gradients of temperature and oxygen-mediated by physiology, behavior, evolution, dispersal, and species interactions. These shifts reassemble food webs and can have dramatic consequences. Compared with species on land, marine species are more sensitive to changing climate but have a greater capacity for colonization. These differences suggest that species cope with climate change at different spatial scales in the two realms and that range shifts across wide spatial scales are a key mechanism at sea. Additional research is needed to understand how processes interact to promote or constrain range shifts, how the dominant responses vary among species, and how the emergent communities of the future ocean will function.},

abstract = {We present a new methodology to estimate rates of energy acquisition, maintenance, reproductive investment and the onset of maturation (four-trait estimation) by fitting an energy allocation model to individual growth trajectories. The accuracy and precision of the method is evaluated on simulated growth trajectories. In the deterministic case, all life history parameters are well estimated with negligible bias over realistic parameter ranges. Adding environmental variability reduces precision, causes the maintenance and reproductive investment to be confounded with a negative error correlation, and tends, if strong, to result in an underestimation of the energy acquisition and maintenance and an overestimation of the age and size at the onset of maturation. Assuming a priori incorrect allometric scaling exponents also leads to a general but fairly predictable bias. To avoid confounding in applications we propose to assume a constant maintenance (three-trait estimation), which can be obtained by fitting reproductive investment simultaneously to size at age on population data. The results become qualitatively more robust but the improvement of the estimate of the onset of maturation is not significant. When applied to growth curves back-calculated from otoliths of female North Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa, the four-trait and three-trait estimation produced estimates for the onset of maturation very similar to those obtained by direct observation. The correlations between life-history traits match expectations. We discuss the potential of the methodology in studies of the ecology and evolution of life history parameters in wild populations.},

abstract = {This study presents a model of a forager searching for prey in a stochastic hierarchical patch system where high-density patches at small scales are nested within low-density patches at larger scales. In order to track the system, the forager uses long travel distances within large-scale patches and short travel distances within small-scale patches. The forager estimates its position in the system according to recent experience and changes its search pattern accordingly. The scaling of the prey system was adapted according to marine pelagic systems of krill and schooling fish, and a forager was simulated for varying prey abundance and prey aggregation. The model suggests that tracking efficiency, defined as the forager's mean position within the system, increases for increasing prey abundance. Furthermore, the model suggests that maximum tracking efficiency is found at intermediate prey aggregations and that tracking efficiency decreases for aggregations above and below this point. The model demonstrates that a well-structured hierarchical patch system with high general prey density might potentially increase the information flow and, hence, the tracking efficiency of a predator. It is suggested that these results might be applicable to a wide array of systems where predators track unpredictable hierarchical patch systems.},

abstract = {Trends in abundance of spring and summer chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Salmo gairdneri returning to the Snake River and mid-Columbia River above Priest Rapids Dam were determined by analyzing the percentage of adults returning from the smolt out-migrations of 1962–1984. Runs declined as a result of hydroelectric development of the river; the main cause for the decline was the mortality of juveniles migrating downstream through as many as nine dams and impoundments en route to the ocean. Mid-Columbia River summer chinook salmon runs experienced the greatest decline because of higher mortalities incurred during their migration to sea as subyearlings in July and August. Mortality was lower for remaining races of fish that migrate to sea as yearlings in the spring during higher river flows, more spill at dams, and cooler water temperatures. Enhancement measures to offset dam-related mortality of smolts began in 1970 on the Snake River and in 1975 on the mid-Columbia River. These measures included increased numbers of smolts released from hatcheries, spillway deflectors to reduce dissolved gas saturation, fingerling bypasses at dams, transportation of smolts around dams, supplemental river flows to minimize delay for smolts passing through reservoirs, and supplemental spill at dams to minimize turbine mortality of smolts at dams without fingerling bypasses. These actions have reversed the decline of steelhead but not of salmon. Enhancement has improved the rate of return of wild spring chinook salmon, but wild fish contribution is minimal at this time because stocks were reduced by earlier hydroelectric development. Presently, runs are mostly of hatchery origin and have not responded well to enhancement. Mortality of hatchery fish may be due to activation of bacterial kidney disease by stresses encountered during downriver migrations, transportation, or subsequent transition into seawater.},

Understanding how these activities translate into ecological consequences is exceedingly challenging because of the inherent complexity within natural systems and the variability in how stressors act and how species respond. While there have been substantial advancements within the field of cumulative effects assessment to address these issues and improve our understanding of the consequences of our actions, many challenges remain. Here, we detail advances and remaining challenges, and propose five priorities for addressing these challenges in the near future. In particular, we suggest prioritizing risk-based approaches that account for uncertainty in our understanding and establishing an underlying theory for when we expect particular impacts to occur. We also propose the need for a defined subdiscipline focused on cumulative effects, to help reduce the silos of research that are often disconnected, and to work toward a common set of definitions, methods and the consistent use of open data.},

abstract = {Although both niche-based and neutral processes are involved in community assembly, most models on the effects of habitat loss are stochastic, assuming neutral communities mainly affected by ecological drift and random extinction. Given that habitat loss is considered the most important driver of the current biodiversity crisis, unraveling the processes underlying the effects of habitat loss is critical from both a theoretical and an applied perspective. Here we unveil the importance of niche-based and neutral processes to species extinction and community assembly across a gradient of habitat loss, challenging the predictions of neutral models. We draw on a large dataset containing the distribution of 3653 individuals of 42 species, representing 35% of the small mammal species of the Atlantic Forest hotspot, obtained in 68 sites across three continuously-forested landscapes and three adjacent 10 000-ha fragmented landscapes differing in the amount of remaining forest (50%, 30% and 10%). By applying a null-model approach, we investigated $\beta$-diversity patterns by detecting deviations of observed community similarity from the similarity between randomly assembled communities. Species extinction following habitat loss was decidedly non-random, in contrast to the notion that fragmented communities are mainly driven by ecological drift. Instead, habitat loss led to a strong biotic homogenization. Moreover, species composition changed abruptly at the same level of landscape-scale habitat loss that has already been associated with a drastic decline in species richness. Habitat loss, as other anthropogenic disturbances, can thus be seen as a strong ecological filter that increases (rather than decreases) the importance of deterministic processes in community assembly. As such, critical advances for the development of conservation science lie on the incorporation of the relevant niche traits associated with extinction proneness into models of habitat loss. The results also underscore the fundamental importance of pro-active measures to prevent human-modified landscapes surpassing critical ecological thresholds.},

abstract = {Monitoring natural populations is often a necessary step to establish the conservation status of species and to help improve management decisions. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs do not effectively address primary sources of variability in monitoring data, which ultimately may limit the utility of monitoring in identifying declines and improving management. To illustrate the importance of taking into account detectability and spatial variation, we used a recently proposed estimator of abundance (superpopulation estimator) to estimate population size of and number of young produced by the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) in Florida. During the last decade, primary recovery targets set by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Snail Kite that were based on deficient monitoring programs (i.e., uncorrected counts) were close to being met (by simply increasing search effort during count surveys). During that same period, the Snail Kite population declined dramatically (by 55% from 1997 to 2005) and the number of young decreased by 70% between 1992-1998 and 1999-2005. Our results provide a strong practical case in favor of the argument that investing a sufficient amount of time and resources into designing and implementing monitoring programs that carefully address detectability and spatial variation is critical for the conservation of endangered species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Much of this decline is attributable to declining abundance, but some of it has been due to deliberate reduction in allowable exploitation rates. Various reasons have been given for this reduction, but the main rationale appears to have been concern about declines in a few relatively small and unproductive stocks that are intercepted in mixed-stock fisheries. Reductions in exploitation rate have generally not been followed by the increases in stock size that would be expected if overfishing had been the main cause of the declines. Current procedures for setting exploitation rate goals do not appear to involve explicit analysis of the risk-reward trade off relationship between mixed stock exploitation rates and yields.},

abstract = {Two major investigations of the effects of forestry practices on watersheds and fish have been conducted in the coastal region of British Columbia (BC), Canada, within the past three decades. The Carnation Creek Experimental Watershed Project, on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, was initiated in 1970, and the Fish-Forestry Interaction Program (FFIP) on the Queen Charlotte Islands (QCI) was begun in 1981 and concluded by 1994. The Carnation Creek project is a long-term case study now in its 32nd year. The FFIP was a synoptic study covering 30 watersheds. This review summarizes and compares these two projects which used different study designs to examine forestry effects on channel morphology, fish habitat and fish populations. The Carnation Creek project was initiated by researchers to learn about biological and physical processes operating within a coastal watershed, and to study the effects of forestry practices upon these processes. In contrast, the FFIP study was implemented under the direction of senior government managers after large landslides occurred in 1979 following logging on unstable hill-slopes, and after confrontations between government and industry, and widespread public criticism of forestry practices. Both studies have made significant contributions to our knowledge of how watersheds function in northwestern North America and how forestry activities may affect these functions. The two projects were based on different but complementary research approaches, which have enabled the results, taken together, to have significantly more application to forest practices than the results of either study taken individually. Both studies have played critical roles in the development of forest management regulations, guidelines and practices in BC and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest.},

abstract = {Fish stocks fluctuate both in abundance and productivity (net population increase), and there are many examples demonstrating that productivity increased or decreased due to changes in abundance caused by fishing and, alternatively, where productivity shifted between low and high regimes, entirely unrelated to abundance. Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3% of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6%, the mixed hypothesis 30.5%, and the random hypothesis 12.6%. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a critical factor for food production, yet surface freshwaters and some coastal waters are highly sensitive to eutrophication by excessP. A planetary boundary, or upper tolerable limit, for P discharge to the oceans is thought to be ten times the pre-industrial rate, or more than three times the current rate. However this boundary does not take account of freshwater eutrophication. We analyzed the global P cycle to estimate planetary boundaries for freshwater eutrophication. Planetary boundaries were computed for the input of P to freshwaters, the input of P to terrestrial soil, and the mass of P in soil. Each boundary was computed for two water quality targets, 24 mgPm-3, a typical target for lakes and reservoirs, and 160 mgm -3, the approximate pre-industrial P concentration in the world's rivers. Planetary boundaries were also computed using three published estimates of current P flow to the sea. Current conditions exceed all planetary boundaries for P. Substantial differences between current conditions and planetary boundaries demonstrate the contrast between large amounts of P needed for food production and the high sensitivity of freshwaters to pollution by P runoff. At the same time, some regions of the world are P-deficient, and there are some indications that a global P shortage is possible in coming decades. More efficient recycling and retention of P within agricultural ecosystems could maintain or increase food production while reducing P pollution and improving water quality. Spatial heterogeneity in the global P cycle suggests that recycling of P in regions of excess and transfer of P to regions of deficiency could mitigate eutrophication, increase agricultural yield, and delay or avoid global P shortage. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Fisheries and Oceans Canada has collected a unique, long-term data set on the social, biological, and eco- nomic dynamics of Canada's recreational fisheries. Starting in 1975, these data were collected through mail surveys to rec- reational anglers at 5-year intervals. A longitudinal analysis revealed that there was an average of 4.5 million licensed an- glers catching an annual average of 255 million fish. Release rates were relatively high (53% of fish released on average), with recent survey data (2010) suggesting that release rates had exceeded 60%. Recreational anglers also contribute an average of $8.8 billion each year to the Canadian economy. However, recreational angling has become less popular over time, and the average age of participants has increased. The data were also useful for characterizing Canada's fisheries, including species- specific catch and harvest. Canada is one of the few countries to collect such extensive recreational fisheries data at a national scale and to do so at regular intervals, an approach that could be modeled by other countries.},

However, appropriate models to analyse these data, such as generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), are computationally intensive and challenging for many users to implement. Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which extends the flexible interface familiar to users of lme4, glmmTMB, and mgcv to include spatial and spatiotemporal latent GMRFs using an SPDE-(stochastic partial differential equation) based approach. SPDE matrices are constructed with fmesher and estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with TMB or via Bayesian inference with tmbstan and rstan. We describe the model and explore case studies that illustrate sdmTMB's flexibility in implementing penalised smoothers, non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients), hurdle models, cross-validation and anisotropy (directionally dependent spatial correlation). Finally, we compare the functionality, speed, and interfaces of related software, demonstrating that sdmTMB can be an order of magnitude faster than R-INLA. We hope sdmTMB will help open this useful class of models to a wider field of geostatistical analysts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The sustainability of regional development can be usefully explored through several different lenses. In situations in which uncertainties and change are key features of the ecological landscape and social organization, critical factors for sustainability are resilience, the capacity to cope and adapt, and the conservation of sources of innovation and renewal. However, interventions in social-ecological systems with the aim of altering resilience immediately confront issues of governance. Who decides what should be made resilient to what? For whom is resilience to be managed, and for what purpose? In this paper we draw on the insights from a diverse set of case studies from around the world in which members of the Resilience Alliance have observed or engaged with sustainability problems at regional scales. Our central question is: How do certain attributes of governance function in society to enhance the capacity to manage resilience? Three specific propositions were explored: (1) participation builds trust, and deliberation leads to the shared understanding needed to mobilize and self-organize; (2) polycentric and multilayered institutions improve the fit between knowledge, action, and social-ecological contexts in ways that allow societies to respond more adaptively at appropriate levels; and (3) accountable authorities that also pursue just distributions of benefits and involuntary risks enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups and society as a whole. Some support was found for parts of all three propositions. In exploring the sustainability of regional social-ecological systems, we are usually faced with a set of ecosystem goods and services that interact with a collection of users with different technologies, interests, and levels of power. In this situation in our roles as analysts, facilitators, change agents, or stakeholders, we not only need to ask: The resilience of what, to what? We must also ask: For whom?},

abstract = {We describe a novel spatially and temporally detailed approach for determining the cause or causes of a population decline, using the western Alaskan population of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) as an example. Existing methods are mostly based on regression, which limits their utility when there are multiple hypotheses to consider and the data are sparse and noisy. Our likelihood-based approach is unbiased with regard to sample size, and its posterior probability landscape allows for the separate consideration of magnitude and certainty for multiple factors simultaneously. As applied to Steller sea lions, the approach uses a stochastic population model in which the vital rates (fecundity, pup survival, non-pup survival) at a particular rookery in each year are functions of one or more local conditions (total prey availability, species composition of available prey, fisheries activity, predation risk indices). Three vital rates and four scaling functions produce twelve nonexclusive hypotheses, of which we considered 10; we assumed a priori that fecundity would not be affected by fishery activities or predation. The likelihood of all the rookery-and year-specific census data was calculated by averaging across sample paths, using backward iteration and a beta-binomial structure for observation error. We computed the joint maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of parameters associated with each hypothesis and constructed marginal likelihood curves to examine the support for each effect. We found strong support for a positive effect of total prey availability on pup recruitment, negative effects of prey species composition (pollock fraction) on fecundity and pup survival, and a positive effect of harbor seal density (our inverse proxy for predation risk) on non-pup survival. These results suggest a natural framework for adaptive management; for example, the areas around some of the rookeries could be designated as experimental zones where fishery quotas are contingent upon the results of prefishing season survey trawls. We contrast our results with those of previous studies, demonstrating the importance of testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously and quantitatively when investigating the causes of a population decline. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the spatial scale of population structure is fundamental to long-standing tenets of population biology, landscape ecology and conservation. Nonetheless, identifying such scales has been challenging because a key factor that influences scaling – movement among patches or local populations – is a multicausal process with substantial phenotypic and temporal variation. 2. We resolve this problem via a novel application of network modularity. When applied to move-ments, modularity provides a formal description of the functional aggregation of populations and identifies potentially critical scales for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We first test for mod-ularity using several different types of biologically relevant movements across the entire geographic range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). We then ask whether variation in movement based on (i) age, (ii) sex and (iii) time (annual, seasonal and within-season movements) influences spatial population structure (i.e. modularity) in snail kites. 3. We identified significant modularity in annual dispersal of snail kites (all adults, males only, females only, and juveniles only) and in within-breeding season movements of adults, yet no evidence of modularity in seasonal (non-breeding) movements. For those movements with observed modular structure, we found striking similarities in the spatial configuration of population structure, even though movement properties varied considerably among these dif-ferent types of movements. 4. Our results suggest that the emergence of modularity in population networks can be robust despite movement heterogeneity and differences in patch-based measures of connectivity. Fur-thermore, our comparison of the population structure and connectivity across multiple move-ment phases helps to identify wetland patches most critical to population connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales. 5. We argue that understanding modularity in populations may provide a robust complement to existing measures of population structure and connectivity and will help to clarify the lim-iting roles of movement for populations. Such information is increasingly needed for inter-preting population persistence and guiding effective conservation strategies with ongoing environmental change.},

This paper aims to compare three different methods for its estimation. Considering a classical approach, a logistic model was used (a) by determining the gonadal stage macroscopically; and (b) by using the GSI as proxy of sexual maturity; and finally; (c) by using the length–weight relationship (LWR) in a theoretical approach. The proposed methods were applied using data of a detritivorous fish, Cyphocharax abramoides, monthly sampled using gill nets. Captured individuals were measured, weighed, sexed and the gonadal stage was classified macroscopically and weighed. Estimated L 50 values using the macroscopic identification, GSI approach and LWR were not different from each other considering confidence intervals. Between the three different techniques, we concluded that the analysis of the LWR in fishes with polyphasic growth presented promising results as it only requires length and weight data to be performed and estimate a L 50 within the range of both classical logistic models analysed.},

Fisheries management is mainly conducted via single-stock assessment models assuming that fish stocks do not interact, except through assumed natural mortalities. Currently, the main alternative is complex ecosystem models which require extensive data, are difficult to calibrate, and have long run times. We propose a simple alternative. In three case studies each with two stocks, we improve the single-stock models, as measured by Akaike information criterion, by adding correlation in the cohort survival. To limit the number of parameters, the correlations are parameterized through the corresponding partial correlations. We consider six models where the partial correlation matrix between stocks follows a band structure ranging from independent assessments to complex correlation structures. Further, a simulation study illustrates the importance of handling correlated data sufficiently by investigating the coverage of confidence intervals for estimated fishing mortality. The results presented will allow managers to evaluate stock statuses based on a more accurate evaluation of model output uncertainty. The methods are directly implementable for stocks with an analytical assessment and do not require any new data sources.},

abstract = {Interspecific patterns of fish life histories were evaluated in relation to several theoretical models of life-history evolution. Data were gathered for 216 North American fish species (57 families) to explore relationships among variables and to ordinate species. Multivariate tests, performed on freshwater, marine, and combined data matrices, repeatedly identified a gradient associating later-maturing fishes with higher fecundity, small eggs, and few bouts of reproduction during a short spawning season and the opposite suite of traits with small fishes. A second strong gradient indicated positive associations between parental care, egg size, and extended breeding seasons. Phylogeny affected each variable, and some higher taxonomic groupings were associated with particular life-history strategies. High-fecundity characteristics tended to be associated with large species ranges in the marine environment. Age at maturation, adult growth rate, life span, and egg size positively correlated with anadromy. Parental care was inversely correlated with median latitude. A trilateral continuum based on essential trade-offs among three demographic variables predicts many of the correlations among life-history traits. This framework has implications for predicting population responses to diverse natural and anthropogenic disturbances and provides a basis for comparing responses of different species to the same disturbance.},

abstract = {Salmon and herring support both land and ocean predators and are critical to ecosystem resilience. Their linkages across land and sea realms make them highly susceptible to human activities, which can have flow-on effects up the food web. We quantify and compare the potential cumulative effects of human-driven pressures on interdependent species in salmon- and herring-linked ecosystems of western Canada using a risk assessment methodology. Adding indirect risks resulted in 68\% greater total risks for land species than for direct risk alone, versus 15\% for marine species. Inclusion of climate change pressures resulted in the greatest change in risk for low trophic marine species and habitats (greater than 25\% increase). Forestry-related pressures accounted for the highest risk to all species and projected management of these pressures resulted in a total reduction of risk across all ecosystem components that was more than 14\% greater than management of fisheries pressures. Ignoring land food web linkages and pressures underestimated cumulative risk by more than 40\% for salmon and herring. This simple framework can be used to evaluate potential risk of existing human uses and future change to inform immediate management of linked land-sea ecosystems and help species avoid the ‘death by a thousand cuts'.

abstract = {Dense, slow growing populations of bluegill sunfish are common in lakes where heavy vegetation prevents thinning of bluegill numbers by their primary predator, the largemouth bass. Since bass can effectively prey on bluegill only along the periphery of dense macrophyte beds, mowing vegetation to create additional edge may improve growth rates and size structure of both species. While this concept is straightforward, determining the optimal vegetation configuration for the two species is difficult because mechanisms such as feeding, competition, and mortality together determine the population response and may interact in complex ways. This paper describes a model that simulates the interactions of bluegill, largemouth bass and their invertebrate prey in the context of vegetation structure. The model is calibrated to data from a heavily vegetated temperate lake and is used to examine the fish response to additional edge created by mowing channels through plant beds. Bass growth rates and numbers increased after most simulated vegetation removals because their access to prey increased. Bluegill grew fastest when about 30% of the vegetation was cut, but responded negatively to mowing more than about half the plants. Bluegill responded to the manipulations more by changing growth rates, while bass responded more by increasing numbers. Moderate plant removals accomplished by mowing many narrow channels are most likely to simultaneously benefit both species. The model synthesizes current understanding of the relationship between macrophytes, bluegill and largemouth bass, and suggests which vegetation manipulations are most informative to test in large scale experiments.},

Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary deﬁnitions of residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this paper to three example data sets.},

abstract = {Forecasting the colonization process is important for wildlife managers who supervise the reintroduction of endangered species or control the spread of invasive species. Patch connectivity is thus critical to predicting the fates of expanding populations. Connectivity in river networks results from river dendritic structure and dispersal modality of organisms. Both factors may strongly affect the colonization process and the efficiency of conservation action plans. Based on empirical data, we simulated, using a simplified model with limited number of parameters, the colonization of a large river network, the Loire River, by the native Eurasian beaver and the invasive African clawed frog. For each species, we inferred model parameters (dispersal behavior and distances) by comparing the simulated and the observed distributions. Using network theory, we evaluated the efficiency of alternative conservation strategies to prevent or promote colonization of the river network. Network robustness to fragmentation and disturbance was also assessed. The model accurately predicted > 70% of the observed species ranges. Conservation strategies that selectively protect habitat patches with the highest connectivity values provide a weak advantage at preventing connectivity loss compared to random protection strategies. In contrast, the targeted destruction of highly connected patches had a much stronger effect on the fragmentation of the network than the random removal of habitat patches. Spatial network topology strongly contributes to determining colonization patterns of large river watersheds. Network theory allows tests for robustness of rivers to fragmentation and disturbance, and identification of strategies for conservation planning.},

abstract = {The factors responsible for widespread declines of grassland birds in the United States are not well understood. This study, conducted in the short-grass prairie of eastern Wyoming, was designed to investigate the relationship between variation in habitat amount, landscape heterogeneity, prey resources, and spatial variation in grassland bird species richness. We estimated bird richness over a 5-year period (1994–1998) from 29 Breeding Bird Survey locations. Estimated bird richness was modeled as a function of landscape structure surrounding survey routes using satellite-based imagery (1996) and grasshopper density and richness, a potentially important prey of grassland birds. Model specification progressed from simple to complex explanations for spatial variation in bird richness. An information-theoretic approach was used to rank and select candidate models. Our best model included measurements of habitat amount, habitat arrangement, landscape matrix, and prey diversity. Grassland bird richness was positively associated with grassland habitat; was negatively associated with habitat dispersion; positively associated with edge habitats; negatively associated with landscape matrix attributes that may restrict movement of grassland bird; and positively related to grasshopper richness. Collectively, 62% of the spatial variation in grassland bird richness was accounted for by the model (adj-R2 = 0.514). These results suggest that the distribution of grassland bird species is influenced by a complex mixture of factors that include habitat area affects, landscape pattern and composition, and the availability of prey.},

abstract = {We use an individual-based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an "evolutionary rescue" in a fragmented landscape. Kin competition has a quantitative effect on the evolution of migration rate in our model, but these patterns in the evolution of migration rate appear to be primarily caused by spatiotemporal variation in fitness and mortality during migration. We apply the model to real habitat patch networks occupied by two checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea) species, for which sufficient data are available to estimate rigorously most of the model parameters. The model-predicted migration rate is not significantly different from the empirically observed one. Regional variation in patch areas and connectivities leads to regional variation in the optimal migration rate, predictions that can be tested empirically.},

Subsequently, two interrelated frameworks, drawing on the Ostrom framework for the analysis of SESs and adaptive management as key foundations, are presented. These frameworks are useful to structure the complexity and apprehend the various feedbacks and links inherent in any particular recreational fisheries system.

abstract = {The ‘Anthropocene' concept provides a conceptual framework that encapsulates the current global situation in which society has an ever-greater dominating influence on Earth System functioning. Simulation models used to understand earth system dynamics provide early warning, scenario analysis and evaluation of environmental management and policies. This paper aims to assess the extent to which current models represent the Anthropocene and suggest ways forward. Current models do not fully reflect the typical characteristics of the Anthropocene, such as societal influences and interactions with natural processes, feedbacks and system dynamics, tele-connections, tipping points, thresholds and regime shifts. Based on an analysis of current model representations of Anthropocene dynamics, we identify ways to enhance the role of modeling tools to better help us understand Anthropocene dynamics and address sustainability issues arising from them. To explore sustainable futures (‘safe and operating spaces'), social processes and anthropogenic drivers of biophysical processes must be incorporated, to allow for a spectrum of potential impacts and responses at different societal levels. In this context, model development can play a major role in reconciling the different epistemologies of the disciplines that need to collaborate to capture changes in the functioning of socio-ecological systems. Feedbacks between system functioning and underlying endogenous drivers should be represented, rather than assuming the drivers to be exogenous to the modelled system or stationary in time and space. While global scale assessments are important, the global scale dynamics need to be connected to local realities and vice versa. The diversity of stakeholders and potential questions requires a diversification of models, avoiding the convergence towards single models that are able to answer a wide range of questions, but without sufficient specificity. The novel concept of the Anthropocene can help to develop innovative model representations and model architectures that are better suited to assist in designing sustainable solutions targeted at the users of the models and model results.},

abstract = {Managing fisheries using length-based harvest regulations is common, but such policies often create trade-offs among conservation (e.g. maintaining natural age-structure or spawning stock biomass) and fishery objectives (e.g. maximizing yield or harvest numbers). By focusing harvest on the larger (older) fish, minimum-length limits are thought to maximize biomass yield, but at the potential cost of severe age and size truncation at high fishing mortality. Harvest-slot-length limits (harvest slots) restrict harvest to intermediate lengths (ages), which may contribute to maintaining high harvest numbers and a more natural age-structure. However, an evaluation of minimum-length limits vs. harvest slots for jointly meeting fisheries and conservation objectives across a range of fish life-history strategies is currently lacking. We present a general age- and size-structured population model calibrated to several recreationally important fish species. Harvest slots and minimum-length limits were both effective at compromising between yield, numbers harvested and catch of trophy fish while conserving reproductive biomass. However, harvest slots consistently produced greater numbers of fish harvested and greater catches of trophy fish while conserving reproductive biomass and a more natural population age-structure. Additionally, harvest slots resulted in less waste in the presence of hooking mortality. Our results held across a range of exploitation rates, life-history strategies and fisheries objectives. Overall, we found harvest slots to represent a valuable option to meet both conservation and recreational fisheries objectives. Given the ubiquitous benefits of harvest slots across all life histories modelled, rethinking the widespread use of minimum-length limits is warranted.},

abstract = {Current investment in conservation is insufficient to adequately protect and recover all ecosystems and species. The challenge of allocating limited funds is acute for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in Canada, which lack a strategic approach to ensure that resources are spent on actions most likely to cost-effectively recover diminished populations. We applied the Priority Threat Management framework to prioritize strategies most likely to maximize the number of thriving Pacific salmon populations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. These included 79 genetically, ecologically and spatially distinct population groups called conservation units (CUs) for five salmon species. This region has high salmon biodiversity and spans the territories of four First Nations: the Heiltsuk, Nuxalk, Kitasoo/Xai'xais and Wuikinuxv. Using structured expert elicitation of Indigenous and other experts, we quantified the estimated benefits, costs and feasibility of implementing 10 strategies. Under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e. no additional investments in salmon conservation or management), experts predicted that only one in four CUs would have >50% chance of achieving a thriving status within 20 years. Limiting future industrial development in salmon habitats, which was predicted to safeguard CUs from future declines, was identified as the most cost-effective strategy. Investment in three strategies: (a) removal of artificial barriers to fish migration, (b) watershed protection and (c) stream restoration—at 11.3M CAD per year—was predicted to result in nearly half (34 of 79) of the CUs having a >60% chance of meeting the conservation objective. If all conservation strategies were implemented, experts estimated a >50% probability of achieving a thriving status for 78 of 79 CUs, at an annual cost of 17.3M CAD. However, even with the implementation of all strategies, most sockeye salmon CUs were unlikely to achieve higher probability targets of reaching the objective. Policy implications. We illustrate how Priority Threat Management can incorporate the perspectives and expertise of Indigenous peoples and other experts to prioritize conservation strategies based on their cost, benefit and feasibility. Implementation of this framework can help safeguard and recover Pacific salmon in Canada, and could also be used to prioritize actions for other conservation issues globally.},

Thirty-two families of F1 crosses, along with five pure GR and two pure CR rainbow trout families, were then evaluated for resistance to whirling disease after experimental exposure to Myxobolus cerebralis. The pure domesticated GR strain was verified to have strong resistance to the parasite. In contrast, wild CR rainbow trout were highly susceptible. Crosses of these two strains resulted in offspring with a range of susceptibility. The resistance to whirling disease in some families was similar to that of pure GR rainbow trout, while other families were as susceptible as pure CR rainbow trout. Infection severity was significantly greater in the CR strain than in the pure GR and the GR 3 CR strains, as measured by both microscopic pathological scores (histology) and myxospore counts. Infection severity in the reciprocal crosses (CR female 3 GR male) was not significantly different from that of the pure CR rainbow trout as measured by histology but was significantly different with respect to lower myxospore counts.

Angling effort, particularly during the open-water season. was highest and often exceeded estimated Sustainable levels on lakes with good road access. Approximately 25% of the remote lakes also received excessive pressure during the winter season. Angler numerical responses to lake trout abundance were detected in remote lakes. but 1101 in road-accessible lakes. Smallmouth bass were more prevalent in lakes with road access and human settlement (either cottages or lodges), supporting the theory that they were introduced into these lakes. Lake trout populations were depleted throughout much of the Study range. Even without road access or smallmouth bass, lake trout abundance was still 47% lower than in unexploited reference lakes. When bass and (or) road access were present, lake trout abundance decreased by 77%. Remote lake trout populations in this area are clearly vulnerable to the negative impacts of improved access, a vector for both overexploitation and species introductions.},

abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods have recently been combined with conventional methods for fisheries stock assessment (e.g. catch-age analysis) to provide a conceptually elegant approach for providing fishery management advice under uncertainty. Uncertainties in the advice provided can be conveyed using posterior probability distributions (or 'posteriors') for the potential outcomes of each policy option. Posteriors can be estimated using data (e.g. catch-age data and relative abundance indices) for the fish population of interest and prior probability distributions for population model parameters (e.g. stock-recruit function parameters) based on data from similar fish populations. Despite growing interest, Bayesian methods remain accessible to relatively few. To increase the accessibility of these methods, the conceptual basis for Bayesian statistical estimation is reviewed and set in the context of fisheries stock assessment. The use of Bayesian methods is illustrated by fitting a logistic model to relative abundance indices for Namibian hake (Merlucius capensis and M. paradoxus) and presenting a decision analysis of alternative harvest policy options. Some alternative approaches are outlined for constructing prior and posterior probability distributions and some recent applications in fisheries. Some of the problems that can be encountered while implementing Bayesian methods are also discussed.},

abstract = {(1) Starlings that were feeding nestlings collected mealworms from an artificial feeder where the cumulative number of prey was a logarithmic function of patch residence time (Tp). The patch was placed at various locations between 8 m and 600 m away from the nests. The number of prey swallowed, Tp, and number delivered to the young was recorded in 1364 round trips. (2) Four models of optimal Tp are discussed: (a) Maximize YIELD: energy collected per total round trip time (including time in the nest); (b) Maximize rate of DELIVERY: YIELD minus parent's metabolism; (c) Maximize FAMILY GAIN: DELIVERY minus brood's metabolism, considering the energy cost of begging by the chicks; (d) Maximize EFFICIENCY :YIELD/parent's metabolism. Relevant when there is a cost in spending energy (for example due to constraints in maximum rate of heat dissipation). (3) The results differ significantly from the YIELD and EFFICIENCY models. The FAMILY GAIN model gives the best fit to the data. (4) The variance in Tp reflects the cost of deviations from the optimum. The frequency distribution of observed Tp resembled the predictions of a descriptive model (PROFIT- ABILITY MATCHING) based on proportional alocation of effort to various behavioural options depending on their relative pay-off. (5) Manipulations in brood size resulted in different allocation of food between parent and young but did not affect overall Tp.},

Counts of the maximum number seen in any one field of view were used to estimate relative abundance of 347 spe- cies of bony fishes, cartilaginous fishes and sea snakes. Boosted regression trees were used to assess the influence of depth and location of sampling sites on species richness. Multivariate regression trees and indices of specificity and fidelity (Dufr{\^{e}}ne-Legendre indices) were used to distinguish 17 spatially contiguous vertebrate groups within a hierarchy of spatial scales. Location across the shelf and depth had the greatest influence on species richness, with peaks occurring around the $\sim$35 m iso- bath in the inter-reef waters of the reef matrix, coinciding with shallow banks and shoals. Richness increased slightly toward the equator. Nine terminal vertebrate communities parallel to the coast were distinguished inshore and offshore in deep and shallow water along a latitudinal gradient. There were important community boundaries at Bowen in the south, Townsville in the centre, and Cape Flattery in the north. Latitudinal groupings were most evident inshore. Offshore communities were spatially extensive and separated lagoonal, mid-shelf and outer-shelf sites. Community bound- aries were correlated with knowledge of strong gradients in sedimentary and oceanographic pro- cesses influenced by the shape of the reef matrix and regional tides and currents.},

Is the application of a management procedure (MP), evaluated using simulation tests [i.e. a MP approach otherwise known as management strategy evaluation (MSE)], to recommend total allowable catches (TACs) with constraints desired by industry on the extent of interannual changes viable for such resources, particularly given the customarily lengthy MP evaluation process? This question is examined by considering the rapid boom and then bust situation that arose for the South African fishery for sardine (Sardinops sagax) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) across the turn of the century. Novel adaptations to the MP in place at the time of the boom allowed enhanced resource use during the boom period without compromising the risk of unintended depletion of the populations. Importantly a two-tier threshold system allowed the normal constraints on the maximum extent of interannual TAC reduction to be modified when TACs rose above the specified thresholds. The general protocol underlying the application of MPs for South African fisheries proved sufficiently flexible for the approach to continue to be applied, despite the unanticipated rapid fish population boom and then bust experienced. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Catch-age analysis has become a standard tool for modern stock assessment, where it is recognized that population estimates are linked to estimates of the natural mortality rate M. We use state space models and simulation–estimation cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In particular, we design a simulation model with realistic measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from an estimation model simplified to conform with common assumptions. We describe circumstances in which, simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The variance ratio $\rho$ relating process error in recruitments with measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for $\rho$. In general, estimation models perform better when the true $\rho$ is specified and measurement error is low, so that recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability. Thus, well-designed data collection programs are critical to the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. Effective management of socioecological systems requires an understanding of the complex interactions between people and the environment. In recreational fisheries, which are prime examples of socioecological systems, anglers are analogous to mobile predators in natural predator-prey systems, and individual fisheries in lakes across a region are analogous to a spatially structured landscape of prey patches. Hence, effective management of recreational fisheries across large spatial scales requires an understanding of the dynamic interactions among ecological density dependent processes, landscape-level characteristics, and angler behaviors. We focused on the stocked component of the open access rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fishery in British Columbia (BC), and we used an experimental approach wherein we manipulated stocking densities in a subset of 34 lakes in which we monitored angler effort, fish abundance, and fish size for up to seven consecutive years. We used an empirically derived relationship between fish abundance and fish size across rainbow trout populations in BC to provide a measure of catch-based fishing quality that accounts for the size-abundance trade off in this system. We replicated our experimental manipulation in two regions known to have different angler populations and broad-scale access costs. We hypothesized that angler effort would respond to variation in stocking density, resulting in spatial heterogeneity in angler effort but homogeneity in catch-based fishing quality within regions. We found that there is an intermediate stocking density for a given lake or region at which angler effort is maximized (i.e., an optimal stocking density), and that this stocking density depends on latent effort and lake accessibility. Furthermore, we found no clear effect of stocking density on our measure of catch-based fishing quality, suggesting that angler effort homogenizes catch-related attributes leading to an eroded relationship between stocking density and catch-based fishing quality at the timescale of annual surveys. We conclude that declines in fishing quality resulting from understocking (due to declines in catch rate with low fish abundance) and overstocking (due to suppressed growth and limited recruitment at high density) give an optimal stocking rate that depends on accessibility and latent effort.},

Here we combine observations with an ensemble of climate model simulations to show that teleconnections between the North Pacific and the weak 2014/2015 El Ni{\~{n}}o linked the atmospheric forcing patterns of this event. These teleconnection dynamics from the extratropics to the tropics during winter 2013/14, and then back to the extratropics during winter 2014/15, are a key source of multi-year persistence of the North Pacific atmosphere. The corresponding ocean anomalies map onto known patterns of North Pacific decadal variability, specifically the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) in 2014 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 2015. A large ensemble of climate model simulations predicts that the winter variance of the NPGO- and PDO-like patterns increases under greenhouse forcing, consistent with other studies suggesting an increase in the atmospheric extremes that lead to drought over North America. In 2014–2015 the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced a strong marine heatwave. This study shows teleconnections to the tropical Pacific and the weak El Ni{\~{n}}o were key sources in the atmospheric forcing and persistence of the event.},

abstract = {Many species traverse multiple habitats across ecosystems to complete their life histories. Degradation of critical, life stage-specific habitats can therefore lead to population bottlenecks and demographic deficits in sub-populations. The riparian zone of waterways is one of the most impacted areas of the coastal zone because of urbanisation, deforestation, farming and livestock grazing. We hypothesised that sink populations can result from alterations of habitats critical to the early life stages of diadromous fish that use this zone, and tested this with field-based sampling and experiments. We found that for Galaxias maculatus, one of the most widely distributed fishes of the southern hemisphere, obligate riparian spawning habitat was very limited and highly vulnerable to disturbance across 14 rivers in New Zealand. Eggs were laid only during spring tides, in the highest tidally influenced vegetation of waterways. Egg survival increased to >90% when laid in three riparian plant species and where stem densities were great enough to prevent desiccation, compared to no survival where vegetation was comprised of other species or was less dense. Experimental exclusion of livestock, one of the major sources of riparian degradation in rural waterways, resulted in quick regeneration, a tenfold increase in egg laying by fish and a threefold increase in survival, compared to adjacent controls. Overall, there was an inverse relationship between river size and egg production. Some of the largest rivers had little or no spawning habitat and very little egg production, effectively becoming sink populations despite supporting large adult populations, whereas some of the smallest pristine streams produced millions of eggs. We demonstrate that even a wide-ranging species with many robust adult populations can be compromised if a stage-specific habitat required to complete a life history is degraded by localised or more diffuse impacts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. The first relatively complete landscape-scale social–ecological system (SES) model of a recreational fishery was developed and ground-truthed with independent angling effort data. Based on the British Columbia multistock recreational fishery for rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss), the model includes hundreds of individual lake fisheries, hundreds of thousands of anglers, originating from tens of communities, connected by complex road and trail networks, all distributed over a landscape of approximately half a million square kilometres. The approach is unique in that it incorporates realistic and empirically derived behavioural interactions within and among the three key components of the SES: angler communities, fish populations, and management policies. Current management policies were characterized and alternate policies assessed by simulation. We examined spatial patterns in ecological and social properties of the SES and used simulations to investigate the impacts of alternate management policies on these patterns. Simulation outcomes strongly depended on the spatial redistribution of anglers across the landscape, existing road networks, heterogeneity in angler behaviours, and the spatial pattern of fish population productivity.},

abstract = {There is great demand for marine baitfish in U. S. coastal states. The supply of marine baitfish in the United States is almost completely wild caught, and this fishery is seasonal and inconsistent. Aquaculture may be able to consistently supply marine baitfish for anglers. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of stocking density and salinity on the growth and survival of pinfish Lagodon rhomboides cultured in recirculating aquaculture systems. For the stocking density experiment, juvenile pinfish were stocked (50, 200, 400, and 600 fish/m(3)) into 1,600-L circular tanks in three identical recirculating systems with a salinity of 27 g/L and were cultured for 82 d. Mean survival was not statistically different among densities and ranged from 94.3% to 99.18%. Daily growth of pinfish ranged from 0.35 to 0.39 g . fish(-1) . d(-1). Mean percent weight gain ranged from 624% to 690% and followed a density-dependent trend. Final total length followed a density-dependent pattern, with each increasing density exhibiting statistically significant decreases in length. Mean feed conversion ratio (FCR) ranged from 1.70 to 1.89. In the salinity experiment, juvenile pinfish were stocked at a density of 120 fish/m(3) into 1,600-L tanks within four identical recirculating systems and were cultured for 65 d. Treatment salinities were 9 or 27 g/L; each salinity level was maintained in two systems. Two size-classes were stocked separately into two tanks within all four systems, resulting in four replicates per treatment. Mean survival was not significantly different among treatments and ranged from 98.2% to 99.9%. Mean percent weight gain ranged from 234% to 284%, with no significant differences between salinities. Mean FCR ranged from 2.5 to 3.1 and did not significantly differ between salinities, although fish in the small size-class converted feed more efficiently than those in the large size-class. Pinfish show great potential as a new aquaculture species and can be successfully cultured in recirculating systems at stocking densities of 600 fish/m(3) and at a salinity as low as 9g/L.},

This vast resource includes more than 250,000 lakes and offers angling opportunities for many popular species (e.g., walleye Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum), lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, brook trout S. fontinalis, northern pike Esox lucius, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, largemouth bass M. salmoides, and muskellunge E. masquinongy). In pioneer days, the “apparently inexhaustible abundance of resources” fostered an open-access policy promoting the recreational use of these resources for the benefit of the economy. After World War II, there was a rapid increase in angling effort and by the 1970s many lakes were being overexploited. Clearly, an unrestricted, open-access policy was no longer appropriate. The result has been a rapid proliferation of fishing regulations as exceptions to divisionwide regulations that were created to protect lakes where problems were detected. The growin...},

abstract = {Today, many seabird species nest in port areas, which are also necessary for human economic activity. In this paper, we evaluate, using a metapopulation model, the possibilities for creating alternative breeding sites for the Common Tern ( Sterna hirundo ) in the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt estuary. We explore 22 scenarios that differ with respect to (1) loss of breeding habitat in port areas, (2) location and size of newly created habitat, and (3) coexistence of old and new habitat. Results indicate that loss of port area habitats results in a serious 41% decline in the breeding population. When the loss in ports is compensated for within the ports, the decline was negligible. Fourteen scenarios result in an increase of the Common Tern metapopulation. In these, extra breeding habitat is created outside the ports in fish-rich waters, resulting in a potential metapopulation increase of 25%. However, the period of overlap between lost and newly created habitat strongly affects the results. A gap between the removal of old and the creation of new breeding areas might cause a drop in the metapopulation level of 30%. The population recovery from this drop might take more than 100 years due to slow recolonization. Our results suggest that conservation of seabird species should be evaluated on a metapopulation scale and that the creation of new habitat may help to compensate for habitat loss in other areas. Furthermore, the results indicate that overlap between the existence of old and newly created breeding habitats is crucial for the success of compensation efforts. However, new locations should be carefully selected, because not only is the suitability of the breeding grounds important, but ample fish availability nearby is also key.},

Electrofishing catch per hour (CPH) and catch per kilometer (CPK) were also compared to determine if each expression provided similar trends in CPUE. Correlations between day CPH and day CPK (r ϭ 0.99; P Ͻ 0.0001) and night CPH and night CPK (r ϭ 0.97; P Ͻ 0.0001) suggested that both measures provided similar trends in CPUE. Night CPH significantly exceeded day CPH, and spring CPH significantly exceeded fall CPH. Catchability (q) decreased with increasing density; therefore, CPH increased nonlinearly with density. Day CPH in fall decreased with increasing Secchi depth and water temperature but was unrelated to largemouth bass density. Day CPH in spring decreased with increasing Secchi depth and water temperature and increased with increasing density of largemouth bass and water conductivity. Night CPH in fall increased with increasing density and decreased with decreasing water conductivity, and night CPH in spring increased with increasing density and decreasing percent littoral area (percent of lake with depth less than 4.6 m) among lakes. These variables explained 44% of day CPH in fall, 75% of day CPH in spring, 28% of night CPH in fall, and 59% of night CPH in spring. Effects of density on q must be determined and environmental conditions must be similar before CPUE can be a useful index of largemouth bass density.},

abstract = {An enduring challenge for ecology is identifying the drivers of ecosystem and population stability. In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system's response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.},

For decades, agriculturalists (270+ years) and entomologists (45+ years) have recognized the thermal integral, known as the growing degree-day (GDD, °C{\textperiodcentered}day), to be a reliable predictor of growth and development. Fish and fisheries researchers have yet to widely acknowledge the power of the GDD in explaining growth and development among fishes. We demonstrate that fish length-at-day (LaD), in most cases prior to maturation, is a strong linear function of the GDD metric that can explain >92% of the variation in LaD among 41 data sets representing nine fish species drawn from marine and freshwater en- vironments, temperate and tropical climes, constant and variable temperature regimes, and laboratory and field studies. The GDD demonstrates explanatory power across large spatial scales, e.g., 93% of the variation in LaD for age-2 to -4 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) across their entire range (17 stocks) is explained by one simple GDD function. Moreover, GDD can explain much of the variation in fish egg development time and in aquatic invertebrate (crab) size-at-age. Our analysis extends the well-established and physiologically relevant GDD metric to fish where, relative to conven- tional time-based methods, it provides greater explanatory power.

abstract = {This study evaluates the sensitivity of Washington State's freshwater habitat of Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to climate change. Our analysis focuses on summertime stream temperatures, seasonal low flows, and changes in peak and base flows because these physical factors are likely to be key pressure points for many of Washington's salmon populations. Weekly summertime water temperatures and extreme daily high and low streamflows are evaluated under multimodel composites for A1B and B1 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Simulations predict rising water temperatures will thermally stress salmon throughout Washington's watersheds, becoming increasingly severe later in the twenty-first century. Streamflow simulations predict that basins strongly influenced by transient runoff (a mix of direct runoff from cool-season rainfall and springtime snowmelt) are most sensitive to climate change. By the 2080s, hydrologic simulations predict a complete loss of Washington's snowmelt dominant basins, and only about ten transient basins remaining in the north Cascades. Historically transient runoff watersheds will shift towards rainfall dominant behavior, undergoing more severe summer low flow periods and more frequent days with intense winter flooding. While cool-season stream temperature changes and impacts on salmon are not assessed in this study, it is possible that climate-induced warming in winter and spring will benefit parts of the freshwater life-cycle of some salmon populations enough to increase their reproductive success (or overall fitness). However, the combined effects of warming summertime stream temperatures and altered streamflows will likely reduce the reproductive success for many Washington salmon populations, with impacts varying for different life history-types and watershed-types. Diminishing streamflows and higher stream temperatures in summer will be stressful for stream-type salmon populations that have freshwater rearing periods in summer. Increased winter flooding in transient runoff watersheds will likely reduce the egg-to-fry survival rates for ocean-type and stream-type salmon. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Black sea bass captured by hook and line in Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts, were tagged and held in wire cages on site for 48 h. Hook location and physical condition were recorded for each fish. Concurrently, black sea bass used as controls were collected from commercial fish pots, tagged, and held under similar conditions. A preliminary experiment established that neither tagging nor densities up to 12 fish per cage caused mortality. During the 48-h posthooking period, 3 of the 64 fish tested died, resulting in an estimated hooking mortality of 4.7%. The three fatalities were among five fish hooked in the esophagus. We concluded that survival is high among small caught-and-released black sea bass (<27 cm standard length) and that release of hooked fish has little effect on total fishing mortality.},

abstract = {Many effects of diseases on cultured fish are known; they are less clear in wild fish populations. Cultured fish represent captive populations that can be subjected to intense scrutiny with an increasing range of diverse and powerful tools. Disease represents a spectrum from acute mortality to rather benign or inconsequential syndromes, all sharing the common feature of a deviation from the normal structure or function of the host. Understanding these deviations among cultured and wild fish populations and balancing their implications against ecological, economic, and political concerns are challenges for both fish health scientists and fisheries managers. The severity of a given disease is dependent on the interaction of numerous variables of the host, the parasite, and the environment. To understand diseases and their impacts on fish populations, we must know which variables are important, how we measure them, and finally how we assess the results of our measurements. We have perhaps been most successful with variables associated with the pathogen. We often can more easily isolate and scrutinize the pathogen than either the host or the environment. The host variables of importance (for which we lack considerable knowledge) include actions of the immune system in general and specifically the influence of genetics and nutrition on host resistance–susceptibility to disease. Lastly, the contribution of the environment, a nebulous term encompassing everything other than the host and pathogen, is only partly appre- ciated. While we can measure certain physical and chemical parameters of the environment, we have a poor understanding of the biological–ecological variables that influence host–pathogen interactions. Ultimately, diseases of wild fish must be considered in the context of these complex interactions including numerous physical, chemical, biological, and ecological parameters, which may yet be discovered as integral parts of the aquatic habitat.},

Around Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, BC, Canada, bull kelp floating canopies were mapped using high-resolution imagery from 2005 to 2022, whereas the largest kelp bed of the area was mapped with medium-resolution imagery spanning from 1972 to 2022. In order to understand spatial patterns of kelp resilience, the abiotic characteristics were used to organize the coastline into four clusters, ranging from the coldest and most exposed coast to a more sheltered and warmer location. Additionally, local-scale sea surface temperatures, winds, and marine heatwaves were categorized by global-scale temporal conditions defined by the positive/negative oceanic oscillations of the Oceanic Ni{\~{n}}o Index (ONI) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Comparing spatial and temporal categories, we observed that years with positive ONI and PDO, in particular the 2014–2019 period, concentrated most of the marine heatwaves and the spring temperature peaks. However, there are some indications of an underlying long-term trend. During the period 2020–2022, when ONI and PDO were negative, summer temperatures kept increasing and wind displayed a higher frequency of extreme events. Mapped kelp showed different trends to these stressors: the coldest and most exposed area showed a constant presence of kelp during the entire period, even dating back to 1972. Warmer and semi-sheltered coasts increased in kelp percentage cover after the positive ONI+PDO period of 2014–2019, and the coasts facing the Strait of Georgia displayed a lower kelp percentage cover than the other clusters. In summary, bull kelp was resilient in the study area, but for different reasons: colder and more exposed coasts had the most favorable conditions for kelp, but warmer and more sheltered coastal kelp beds may have benefited from wind-wave forcing.},

Inspired by the recent Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, the leaders of the G8+5 nations commissioned a similar assessment of the economics of losing biodiversity, under the Potsdam Initiative on Biodiversity. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for such a global assessment which emphasizes several critical insights from the environmental economics and valuation literature: contrasting counterfactual scenarios which differ solely in whether they include specific conservation policies; identifying non-overlapping benefits; modeling the production, flow, use and value of benefits in a spatially-explicit way; and incorporating the likely costs as well as possible benefits of policy interventions. Tackling these challenges, we argue, will significantly enhance our ability to quantify how the loss of benefits derived from ecosystems and biodiversity compares with the costs incurred in retaining them. We also summarise a review of the current state of knowledge, in order to assess how quickly this framework could be operationalized for some key ecosystem services. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions.

abstract = {Restoring salmon populations depends on our ability to predict the consequences of improving aquatic habitats used by salmon. Using a Leslie matrix model for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that specifies transitions among spawning nests (redds), streams, tidal deltas, nearshore habitats, and the ocean, we compared the relative importance of different habitats under three density-dependent scenarios: juvenile density independence, density-dependent mortality within streams, delta, and nearshore, and density-dependent migration among streams, delta, and nearshore. Each scenario assumed density dependence during spawning. We examined how these scenarios influenced priorities for habitat restoration using a set of hypothetical watersheds whose habitat areas could be systematically varied, as well as the Duwamish and Skagit rivers. In all watersheds, the three scenarios shared high sensitivity to changes in in nearshore and ocean mortality and produced similar responses to changes in other parameters controlling mortality (i.e., habitat quality). However, the three scenarios exhibited striking variation in population response to changes in habitat area (i.e., capacity). These findings indicate that nearshore habitat relationships may play significant roles for salmon populations and that the relative importance of restoring habitat area will depend on the mechanism of density dependence influencing salmon stocks.},

abstract = {Abstract Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be effective tools for marine resource management. However, despite evidence of the positive effects of MPAs, such as increases in body sizes of organisms targeted by fisheries, there is often heterogeneity in biological outcomes among them. Because fishing can drastically impact fish populations, the goal of this study was to determine if the levels of exploitation prior to protection could predict variation in the magnitude of MPA effects. Using a diver-operated stereo?video camera system, we compared sizes of fishes targeted by anglers within seven MPAs spanning the Southern California Bight to nearby comparison areas (non-MPAs). We used fine-scale data on pre-closure fishing pressure to test responses of fishes to protection along a gradient of exploitation. Fish size responded to protection in proportion to pre-closure fishing pressure, with MPAs in areas with high pre-closure fishing having greater responses in average lengths and size distributions than those in areas with low fishing pressure. This response was evident in species heavily targeted by recreational fishing, but not in species that were not targeted in fisheries. Synthesis and applications. Pre-closure fishing pressure of an area can impact the efficacy of MPAs, and, when available, should be considered when predicting and evaluating MPA performance. Prioritizing heavily exploited areas for protection when implementing spatial management tools could maximize ecological outcomes.},

abstract = {<p>Predation risk and competition among conspecifics significantly affect survival of juvenile salmon, but are rarely incorporated into models that predict recruitment in salmon populations. Using densities of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and numbers of hatchery-released Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts as covariates in spatially structured Bayesian hierarchical stock–recruitment models, we found significant negative correlations between seal densities and productivity of Chinook salmon for 14 of 20 wild Chinook populations in the Pacific Northwest. Changes in numbers of seals since the 1970s were associated with a 74% decrease (95% CI: −85%, −64%) in maximum sustainable yield in Chinook stocks. In contrast, hatchery releases were significantly correlated with Chinook productivity in only one of 20 populations. Our findings are consistent with recent research on predator diets and bioenergetics modeling that suggest there is a relationship between harbour seal predation on juvenile Chinook and reduced marine survival in parts of the eastern Pacific. Forecasting, assessment, and recovery efforts for salmon populations of high conservation concern should thus consider including biotic factors, particularly predator–prey interactions.</p>},

abstract = {Global climate change is shifting the timing of life-cycle events, sometimes resulting in phenological mismatches between predators and prey. Phenological shifts and subsequent mismatches may be consistent across populations, or they could vary unpredictably across populations within the same species. For anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), juveniles from thousands of locally adapted populations migrate from diverse freshwater habitats to the Pacific Ocean every year. Both the timing of freshwater migration and ocean arrival, relative to nearshore prey (phenological match/mismatch), can control marine survival and population dynamics. Here we examined phenological change of 66 populations across six anadromous Pacific salmon species throughout their range in western North America with the longest time series spanning 1951–2019. We show that different salmon species have different rates of phenological change but that there was substantial within-species variation that was not correlated with changing environmental conditions or geographic patterns. Moreover, outmigration phenologies have not tracked shifts in the timing of marine primary productivity, potentially increasing the frequency of future phenological mismatches. Understanding population responses to mismatches with prey are an important part of characterizing overall population-specific climate vulnerability. Shifts in species' migration timing as a result of climate change can result in mismatched temporal overlap with their critical resources. Here the authors show that the magnitude and direction of shifts in juvenile Pacific salmon migration timing vary among species and populations, resulting in variable mismatch with marine productivity, which has implications for climate change vulnerability.},

The Y model predicts that variation in acquisition can mask underlying allocation trade-offs and is a major hypothesis explaining why negative relationships are not always found between traits that are predicted to trade-off with one another. Despite this model's influence on the field of life history evolution, it has rarely been properly tested. We use a model system, the wing dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus as a case study to test the assumptions and predictions of the Y model. By experimentally altering the acquisition regime and by estimating energy acquisition and energy allocation directly in this species, we are able to explicitly test this important model.

How- ever, previous experimental tests have provided no clear consensus on whether the technique works for management. We conducted a series of whole-lake manipulations to test the effects of macrophyte removal on growth of bluegill and largemouth bass. We selected four lakes in south- ern and central Wisconsin for experimental manipulation and nine others for controls. In August 1994, we removed macrophytes from approximately 20% of the littoral zone by cutting a series of evenly spaced, deep channels throughout each treatment lake. In the first year after manipulation, we observed substantially increased growth rates of some age classes of both bluegill and large- mouth bass in treatment lakes relative to controls. Growth rates of other age classes were less responsive to manipulation. We observed increased bluegill and largemouth bass growth despite rapid regrowth of macrophytes in our treatment lakes. By May 1996, fewer than 25% of the chan- nels remained. Our results suggest that harvesting macrophytes in a series of deep channels may be a valuable tool for integrated management of fish and macrophytes.},

abstract = {1. By any measure, fishes are among the worlds most important natural resources. Annual exploitation from wild populations exceeds 90 million tonnes, and fish supply over 15% of global protein needs as part of total annual trade exceeding US 55 billion. Additionally, with over 25 000 known species, the biodiversity and ecological roles of fishes are being increasingly recognised in aquatic conservation, ecosystem management, restoration and aquatic environmental regulation. 2. At the same time, substantial management problems now affect the production, exploitable stocks, global diversity, trophic structure, habitat quality and local composition of fish communities. 3. In marine systems, key issues include the direct effects of exploitation on fish, habitats and other organisms, while habitat or water quality problems arise also from the atmospheric, terrestrial and coastal environments to which marine systems are linked. In freshwaters, flow regulation and obstruction by dams, fragmentation, catchment management, pollution, habitat alterations, exotic fish introductions and nurseryreared fish are widespread issues. 4. Management responses to the problems of fish and fisheries include aquatic reserves in both marine and freshwater habitats, and their effectiveness is now being evaluated. Policies on marine exploitation increasingly emphasise fishes as integral components of aquatic ecosystems rather than individually exploitable stocks, but the rationalisation of fishing pressures presents many challenges. In Europe, North America and elsewhere, policies on freshwaters encourage habitat protection, integrated watershed management and restoration, but pressures on water resources will cause continued change. All these management approaches require development and evaluation, and will benefit from a perspective of ecological understanding with ecologists fully involved. 5. Synthesis and applications . Although making a small contribution to the Journal of Applied Ecology in the past, leading work on aquatic problems and fish-related themes appear increasingly in this and other mainstream ecology journals. As this special profile of five papers shows, significant contributions arise on diverse issues that here include the benefit of aquatic reserves, river restoration for fish, the accumulation of contaminants, interactions with predators, and the fitness of salmonids from nurseries. This overview outlines the current context in which papers on the applied ecology of fish and fisheries are emerging, and it identifies scope for further contributions.

abstract = {A new method is presented to estimate individuals' (1) age at maturation, (2) energy acquisition rate, (3) energy expenditure for body maintenance, and (4) reproductive investment, and the multivariate distribution of these traits in a population. The method relies on adjusting a conceptual energy allocation model to individual growth curves using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The method's performance was tested using simulated growth curves for a range of life-history types. Individual age at maturation, energy acquisition rate and the sum of maintenance and reproductive investment rates, and their multivariate distribution, were accurately estimated. For the estimation of maintenance and reproductive investment rates separately, biases were observed for life-histories with a large imbalance between these traits. For low reproductive investment rates and high maintenance rates, reproductive investment rate estimates were strongly biased whereas maintenance rate estimates were not, the reverse holding in the opposite situation. The method was applied to individual growth curves back-calculated from otoliths of North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and from scales of Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus). For plaice, maturity ogives derived from our individual estimates of age at maturation were almost identical to the maturity ogives based on gonad observation in catch samples. For herring, we observed 51.5% of agreement between our individual estimates and those directly obtained from scale reading, with a difference lower than 1 year in 97% of cases. We conclude that the method is a powerful tool to estimate the distribution of correlated life-history traits for any species for which individual growth curves are available.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists often ignore density dependence because at-risk populations are typically small relative to historical levels. However, if populations are reduced as a result of impacts that lower carrying capacity, then density-dependent mortality may exist at low population abundances. Here, we explore this issue in threatened populations of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ). We followed the fate of more than 50 000 juvenile chinook in the Snake River Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that their survival was inversely associated with juvenile density. We also tested the hypotheses that non-indigenous brook trout and habitat quality affect the presence or strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that juvenile chinook suffer density-dependent mortality and the strength of density dependence was greater in streams in which brook trout were absent. We were unable to detect an effect of habitat quality on the strength of density dependence. Historical impacts of humans have greatly reduced population sizes of salmon, and the density dependence we report may stem from a shortage of nutrients normally derived from decomposing salmon carcasses. Cohorts of juvenile salmon may experience density-dependent mortality at population sizes far below historical levels and recovery of imperiled populations may be much slower than currently expected.},

abstract = {Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary models, particularly those dealing with the evolution of life histories. In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of 'constraint'. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that 'constraint' in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from 'constraint' in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the 'Y-model'). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.},

The timing of both upstream and downstream migrations varied with sex, previous spawning experience, density, and temperature. Inferred spawning duration based on the predicted upstream and downstream migration dates indicated that experienced female spawners spent the least amount of time upstream and first-time spawners spent the most time upstream. No consistent differences in upstream migration timing were observed between non-repetitive and repetitive spawners. We suggest that variations in spawning migration timing observed in Lower Kananaskis Lake may be linked to environmental factors that influence upstream swimming ability and acquisition and expenditure of energy with respect to reproduction.},

abstract = {Many recreational fisheries are subject to varying degrees of catch-and-release fishing through regulations and conservation-minded anglers. Clearly, releasing a proportion of the catch improves conservation of the fishery, yet it is not clear how the released catch contributes to angling quality. If fish change their behavior to lower their individual catchability after they have been caught, then angler catch rates may not be proportional to fish density. Therefore, even catch-and-release fisheries could exhibit poor angling quality if there is sufficiently high angler effort. We tested this idea by experimentally fishing five small lakes that contained rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the interior of British Columbia. We found that with sustained effort of 8 angler-hours�d-1�ha-1 and complete release of the catch, catch rates quickly dropped within 7-10 d. Given the individual capture histories of tagged fish, the most parsimonious catchability model incorporated learning and heterogeneity into intrinsic catchability. The best-fit parameter values suggest that the population contained a group of highly catchable fish that were quickly caught and then learned to avoid hooks. There was a seasonal decrease in catchability that was independent of angling; however, it was not sufficient to explain the data. Our results indicate that catch rates may decline because of high angling effort even when the number of fish remains constant. Therefore, management goals that go beyond conservation issues and attempt to maximize angler satisfaction must account for effort density on a recreational fishery.},

In this study, we (1) provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that source-sink systems help maintain some of the ungulate populations in the Lacandon Forest, Mexico; and (2) test the assumptions that density, age structure, and sex ratios are different in slightly hunted (potential sources) and persistently hunted (potential sinks) populations. From May 1998 to March 2001 we observed 1144 individuals and 1153 tracks of five ungulate species (Baird's tapir, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, red brocket deer, and white-tailed deer) along 1908 km of line transects in slightly and persistently hunted sites of Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (MABR) and adjacent community lands. Densities of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary were lower in persistently hunted sites, where there were higher proportions of young tapirs and white-tailed deer. The sustainability of hunting was evaluated in five communities using information on harvest rates, production rates, and density of each population. Our results suggest that persistently hunted populations of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary are at risk of local extinction, while collared peccary hunting appears to be sustainable. The red brocket deer, although locally overhunted, maintains a relatively safe status probably through a source-sink system in which MABR functions as the source of individuals which are readily hunted in adjacent community lands. Source-sink systems may be also important in maintaining Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary populations outside protected areas of the Lacandon Forest, from evidence of migration observed during this study. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.},

abstract = {Abstract Adaptive management of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires developing methods to evaluate whether monitoring data indicate that they are performing as expected. Modeling the expected responses of targeted species to an MPA network, with a clear timeline for those expectations, can aid in the development of a monitoring program that efficiently evaluates expectations over appropriate time frames. Here, we describe the expected trajectories in abundance and biomass following MPA implementation for populations of 19 nearshore fishery species in California. To capture the process of filling in the age structure truncated by fishing, we used age-structured population models with stochastic larval recruitment to predict responses to MPA implementation. We implemented both demographically open (high larval immigration) and closed (high self-recruitment) populations to model the range of possible trajectories as they depend on recruitment dynamics. From these simulations, we quantified the time scales over which anticipated increases in abundance and biomass inside MPAs would become statistically detectable. Predicted population biomass responses range from little change, for species with low fishing rates, to increasing by a factor of nearly seven, for species with high fishing rates before MPA establishment. Increases in biomass following MPA implementation are usually greater in both magnitude and statistical detectability than increases in abundance. For most species, increases in abundance would not begin to become detectable for at least 10 years after implementation. Overall, these results inform potential indicator metrics (biomass), potential indicator species (those with a high fishing?:?natural mortality ratio), and time frame (>10 yr) for MPA monitoring assessment as part of the adaptive management process.},

abstract = {Life history theories attempt to explain the evolution of organism traits as adaptations to environmental variation. A model involving three primary life history strategies (endpoints on a triangular surface) describes general patterns of variation more comprehensively than schemes that examine single traits or merely contrast fast versus slow life histories. It provides a general means to predict a priori the types of populations with high or low demographic resilience, production potential, and conformity to density-dependent regulation. Periodic (long-lived, high fecundity, high recruitment variation) and opportunistic (small, short-lived, high reproductive effort, high demographic resilience) strategies should conform poorly to models that assume density-dependent recruitment. Periodic-type species reveal greatest recruitment variation and compensatory reserve, but with poor conformity to stock?recruitment models. Equilibrium-type populations (low fecundity, large egg size, parental care) should conform better to assumptions of density-dependent recruitment, but have lower demographic resilience. The model's predictions are explored relative to sustainable harvest, endangered species conservation, supplemental stocking, and transferability of ecological indices. When detailed information is lacking, species ordination according to the triangular model provides qualitative guidance for management and development of more detailed predictive models.},

abstract = {Surplus production modelling has a long history as a method for managing datalimited ﬁsh stocks. Recent advancements have cast surplus production models as state-space models that separate random variability of stock dynamics from error in observed indices of biomass. We present a stochastic surplus production model in continuous time (SPiCT), which in addition to stock dynamics also models the dynamics of the ﬁsheries. This enables error in the catch process to be reﬂected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Beneﬁts of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and ﬁshing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from ﬁve North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufﬁciencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous ﬁsh stock management based on surplus production models.},

In the community-based narwhal management context, a number of issues influence prospects for adaptation and learning. Among the issues examined, the integration of remote communities in Nunavut into the market economy and the subsequent demand for cash to purchase key commodities create new and diverse motivations (collective vs. individual), which increasingly influence natural resource management decisions. Also, the formalized nature of the community-based narwhal management framework, despite efforts to transfer more authority to communities, may still create barriers to local Inuit participation in decision making. Finally, resource mobility and complexity makes the clarification of resource rights difficult, thus inhibiting the collective action required to foster learning. This problem is compounded by the challenge of effectively integrating formal science and traditional knowledge to better understand resource complexity.

Although the general nature of this condition is clear, how the underlying bioeconomic drivers interact to determine the outcome is not. In this paper, we develop a class of spatially explicit models that enable us to explore how different assumptions regarding connectivity and dispersal can lead to different assessments of marine reserves. The analysis also illustrates how the incorporation of space into models of resource exploitation raises fundamental questions about the relationship of aggregate biological production to the production levels in each patch. We show that models with the supraadditivity property - system-wide production is greater than the sum of patch production with no dispersal - are more likely to predict that the benefits of marine reserves outweigh the costs. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Breeding seabirds are extreme central-place foragers, commuting long distances between colonies and feeding areas. Central-place foraging theory predicts that prey items close to the colony will be preferred over prey items distant from the colony, which can lead to prey depletion near the colony (“Storer-Ashmole's halo”). To investigate the relevance of these ideas to a single-prey loader, we equipped chick-rearing Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) with time–depth recorders and monitored prey deliveries. Because feeding rates were constant for chicks days old, we restricted analyses to that age group. Between-date relationships were examined within individuals to avoid confounding effects of specialization and parental quality. The mass of prey items increased with foraging distance which suggests that large prey items were depleted by foraging pressure. Foraging distance for pelagic species increased through the season in years without spawning. After accounting for bathymetry, foraging effort decreased with distance from the colony for benthic fish and, in years without spawning, for pelagic fish. Within each season, Thick-billed Murres “fished down the food web”; they began by feeding on large fish, progressed to medium-sized prey (small fish), and finished feeding on small prey (invertebrates). We concluded that pelagic species responded to seabird foraging pressure by moving away from the colony, creating a three-dimensional halo. Benthic species, meanwhile, were depleted from a nearby shelf but remained abundant at a more distant offshore bench. We suggest that populations of central-place foragers are partially regulated by prey depletion.},

The 1986 Act allocated quota to fishing firms and individuals that met the allocation criteria. Part-time fishers, many of whom were Maori, New Zealand's indigenous people, were excluded from the initial allocation. The 1986 Act did not address claims by Maori of having indigenous rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. Since the Treaty, Maori have protested against government actions and legislation that have eroded their rights guaranteed by the Treaty. The implementation of the 1986 Act prompted further Treaty-based claims to large areas of fisheries, and the ITQ system was used to settle several claims. This paper explores Maori views on resource use and claims to fisheries resources, legislative changes enacted to settle Maori fisheries claims, and claims that remain outstanding.

abstract = {Impact assessments of fishing on a stock require parameterization of vital rates: growth, mortality and recruitment. For ‘data-poor' stocks, vital rates may be estimated from empirical size-based relationships or from life-history invariants. However, a theoretical framework to synthesize these empirical relations is lacking. Here, we combine life-history invariants, metabolic scaling and size-spectrum theory to develop a general size- and trait-based theory for demography and recruitment of exploited fish stocks. Important concepts are physiological or metabolic scaled mortalities and flux of individuals or their biomass to size. The theory is based on classic metabolic relations at the individual level and uses asymptotic size W∞ as a trait. The theory predicts fundamental similarities and differences between small and large species in vital rates and response to fishing. The central result is that larger species have a higher egg production per recruit than small species. This means that density dependence is stronger for large than for small species and has the consequence that fisheries reference points that incorporate recruitment do not obey metabolic scaling rules. This result implies that even though small species have a higher productivity than large species their resilience towards fishing is lower than expected from metabolic scaling rules. Further, we show that the fishing mortality leading to maximum yield per recruit is an ill-suited reference point. The theory can be used to generalize the impact of fishing across species and for making demographic and evolutionary impact assessments of fishing, particularly in data-poor situations.},

abstract = {Recent changes in the seasonal timing (phenology) of familiar biological events have been one of the most conspicuous signs of climate change. However, the lack of a standardized approach to analysing change has hampered assessment of consistency in such changes among different taxa and trophic levels and across freshwater, terrestrial and marine environments. We present a standardized assessment of 25532 rates of phenological change for 726 UK terrestrial, freshwater and marine taxa. The majority of spring and summer events have advanced, and more rapidly than previously documented. Such consistency is indicative of shared large scale drivers. Furthermore, average rates of change have accelerated in a way that is consistent with observed warming trends. Less coherent patterns in some groups of organisms point to the agency of more local scale processes and multiple drivers. For the first time we show a broad scale signal of differential phenological change among trophic levels; across environments advances in timing were slowest for secondary consumers, thus heightening the potential risk of temporal mismatch in key trophic interactions. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, future climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching, further disrupting the functioning, persistence and resilience of many ecosystems and having a major impact on ecosystem services. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock-recruit relationships, Beverton-Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock-recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are fixed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or fisheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor fisheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management.

JAGS was written with three aims in mind: to have an engine for the BUGS language that runs on Unix; to be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions, distributions, and samplers; and to be a platform for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling. JAGS is designed to work closely with the R language and environment for statistical computation and graphics (http://www.r-project.org). You will find it useful to install the coda package for R to analyze the output. You can also use the rjags package to work directly with JAGS from within R (but note that the rjags package is not described in this manual).

abstract = {Migrations are characterized by periods of movement that typically rely on orientation towards directional cues. Anadromous fish undergo several different forms of oriented movement during their spawning migration and provide some of the most well-studied examples of migratory behaviour. During the freshwater phase of the migration, fish locate their spawning grounds via olfactory cues. In this review, we synthesize research that explores the role of olfaction during the spawning migration of anadromous fish, most of which focuses on two families: Salmonidae (salmonids) and Petromyzontidae (lampreys). We draw attention to limitations in this research, and highlight potential areas of investigation that will help fill in current knowledge gaps. We also use the information assembled from our review to formulate a new hypothesis for natal homing in salmonids. Our hypothesis posits that migrating adults rely on three types of cues in a hierarchical fashion: imprinted cues (primary), conspecific cues (secondary), and non-olfactory environmental cues (tertiary). We provide evidence from previous studies that support this hypothesis. We also discuss future directions of research that can test the hypothesis and further our understanding of the spawning migration. {\textcopyright} 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

They are also among the most impacted by human activities and in urgent need of better management and protection. In Canada, eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows are found along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic coasts, and thus occur across a wide range of biogeographic conditions. Here, we synthesize knowledge of eelgrass ecosystems across Canada's coasts, highlighting commonalities and differences in environmental conditions, plant, habitat, and community structure, as well as current trends and human impacts. Across regions, eelgrass life history, phenology, and general species assemblages are similar. However, distinct regional differences occur in environmental conditions, particularly with water temperature and nutrient availability. There is considerable variation in the types and strengths of human activities among regions. The impacts of coastal development are prevalent in all regions, while other impacts are of concern for specific regions, e.g., nutrient loading in the Atlantic and impacts from the logging industry in the Pacific. In addition, climate change represents a growing threat to eelgrass meadows. We review current management and conservation efforts and discuss the implications of observed differences from coast to coast to coast.},

abstract = {1. Type II functional responses, which can be described by Holling's disc equation, have been found in many studies of predator/prey and host/parasite interactions. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that the assumptions on which the disc equation is based do not necessarily hold. We examine the functional response of kleptoparasitically feeding Arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus L.) to the abundance of fish-carrying auks and, by examination of the assumptions of the disc equation, test whether it can explain the function. 2. The rate at which individual skuas make successful chases is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks. However, it would appear that this is not determined by factors that influence their probability of success, but by the rate at which they initiate chases. This too is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks, Arctic skuas have a Type II functional response. 3. Although Arctic skuas exhibited a direct numerical response there was no evidence that components of predation connected to the density of predators (direct prey stealing, or increased host avoidance) had any effect on the rate at which individual skuas made chases or were successful in their chases, We conclude that the observed functional response is free from any effects of interference. 4. We suggest that abnormally high levels of foraging effort expended by breeding skuas and their poor breeding success in the years of observation argue against the limit to the observed functional response being determined by skuas' energetic requirements 5. Several of the assumptions underlying the disc equation do not hold. The duration of chases (handling time) was not a constant; it decreased with increasing host abundance, Moreover, the chase duration predicted by the disc equation, if handling time limited the functional response, was far in excess of that observed. Furthermore, the observed rate of decline in the searching time per victim with increasing host abundance suggested that skuas' instantaneous rate of discovery was also not constant. Possible reasons for these observations are discussed. The basic disc equation may describe Arctic skuas' functional response, but it cannot explain it},

abstract = {We develop the theory of biphasic somatic growth in fish using models based on the distinction between pre- and post-maturation growth and an explicit description of energy allocation within a growing season. We define a 'generic biphasic' (GB) model that assumes post-maturation growth has a von Bertalanffy (vB) form. For this model we derive an explicit expression for the gonad weight/somatic weight ratio (g) which may either remain fixed or vary with size. Optimal biphasic models are then developed with reproductive strategies that maximise lifetime reproductive output. We consider two optimal growth models. In the first (fixed g optimal), gonad weight is constrained to be proportional to somatic weight. In the second (variable g optimal) model, allocation to reproduction is unconstrained and g increases with size. For the first of these two models, adult growth in a scaled measure of length has the exact vB form. When there are no constraints on allocation, growth is vB to a very good approximation. In both models, pre-maturation growth is linear. In a companion paper we use growth data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to test the bioenergetics assumptions used to develop these models, and demonstrate that they have advantages over the vB model, both in quality of fit, and in the information contained in the fitted parameters. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Most fisheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that fish are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that fish movement is such that local fishing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in fishing mortality, growth and recruitment are identified. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and fishery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on fishery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment configurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and final spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and final spawning biomass. Assessment configurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment configuration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and fishery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model configurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model specification.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a project to engage researchers and fishers together in adapting social science approaches to the purposes and the constraints of community-based fisher organizations. The work was carried out in the Scotia-Fundy Region of Atlantic Canada (the Bay of Fundy and Scotian Shelf). Its rationale reflects arguments that (1) effective community-based management requires that managers are able to pose and address social science questions, (2) participatory research, involving true cooperation in all stages, can support this process, and (3) there is a need to overcome practical and methodological barriers faced in developing participatory research protocols, to serve the needs of community-based management while not demanding excessive transaction costs. In this paper, we report on work with fisher organizations, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal, in which social science priorities were set by each organization, and small-scale research projects designed and carried out to meet these needs. This work identified interests among fishers in research on three different levels of meaning: (1) practical livelihood concerns, including what, when and where to fish, and with what intensity of effort, (2) social, economic and political issues (e.g., on institutional structures, politics of access and allocation, overlap and conflict between regulatory regimes), and (3) values and ethics that implicitly or explicitly guide policy development and implementation. Several research themes proved crucial, including those of power sharing, defining boundaries of a community-based group, access and equity, designing effective management plans, enforcement, and scaling up for effective regional and ecosystem-wide management. The research results demonstrate the effectiveness of extending participatory methods to challenge traditional scientific notions of the research process. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Since the 1940s, snow water equivalent (SWE) has decreased throughout the Pacific Northwest, while water use has increased. Climate has been proposed as the primary cause of base-flow decline in the Scott River, an important coho salmon rearing tributary in the Klamath Basin. We took a comparative-basin approach to estimating the relative contributions of climatic and non-climatic factors to this decline. We used permutation tests to compare discharge in 5 streams and 16 snow courses between "historic" (1942-1976) and "modern" (1977-2005) time periods, defined by cool and warm phases, respectively, of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. April 1 SWE decreased significantly at most snow courses lower than 1,800 m in elevation and increased slightly at higher elevations. Correspondingly, base flow decreased significantly in the two streams with the lowest latitude-adjusted elevation and increased slightly in two higher-elevation streams. Base-flow decline in the Scott River, the only study stream heavily utilized for irrigation, was larger than that in all other streams and larger than predicted by elevation. Based on comparison with a neighboring stream draining wilderness, we estimate that 39% of the observed 10 Mm3 decline in July 1-October 22 discharge in the Scott River is explained by regional-scale climatic factors. The remainder of the decline is attributable to local factors, which include an increase in irrigation withdrawal from 48 to 103 Mm3/year since the 1950s. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract = { Biological reference points are used to guide fisheries management decisions. The reference points most often used are expressed in terms of fishing mortality rate (F). F msy relates to the maximization of sustainable yield. In principle, it is a most useful reference point, but in practice it is difficult to estimate. F max and F 0.1 relate to certain levels of yield per recruit and are easily estimated, but they ignore conservation of the resource. Recruitment overfishing has usually been understood to occur when a population has been fished down to a point where recruitment is substantially reduced or fails. It has not been used as a basis for a biological reference point because the definition is vague and cannot be readily related to fishing mortality. Levels of spawning biomass below which recruitment seems to be reduced have been used, but their determination from available data is usually difficult and controversial. We propose an alternative definition of recruitment overfishing in terms of the level of fishing pressure that reduces the spawning biomass of a year class over its lifetime below the spawning biomass of its parents on average. Conventional models and types of data can be used to determine this level of F, denoted as F rep , which clearly relates to the replacement of spawning biomass and thus to sustainability of a population and yield in the long term. },

abstract = {In this paper we consider regression models for count data allow- ing for overdispersion in a Bayesian framework. We account for unobserved heterogeneity in the data in two ways. On the one hand, we consider more flexible models than a common Poisson model allowing for overdispersion in different ways. In particular, the negative binomial and the generalized Poisson (GP) distribution are addressed where overdispersion is modelled by an addi- tional model parameter. Further, zero-inflated models in which overdispersion is assumed to be caused by an excessive number of zeros are discussed. On the other hand, extra spatial variability in the data is taken into account by adding correlated spatial random effects to the models. This approach allows for an underlying spatial dependency structure which is modelled using a condi- tional autoregressive prior based on Pettitt et al. in Stat Comput 12(4):353–367, (2002). In an application the presented models are used to analyse the number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in Germany in the year 2004. Models are compared according to the deviance information criterion (DIC) suggested by Spiegelhalter et al. in J R Stat Soc B64(4):583–640, (2002) and using proper scoring rules, see for exampleGneiting and Raftery inTechnical Report no. 463, University ofWashington, (2004).We observe a rather high degree of overdi- spersion in the datawhich is captured best by theGPmodel when spatial effects are neglected. While the addition of spatial effects to the models allowing for overdispersion gives no or only little improvement, spatial Poisson modelswithspatially correlated or uncorrelated random effects are to be preferred over all other models according to the considered criteria.},

abstract = {Intrapopulation variation in movement is common in nature but its effects on population dynamics are poorly understood. Using movement data from 3270 individually-marked fish representing nine cohorts of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in California, we show that bimodal intrapopulation variation in the timing of juvenile down-migration from their natal habitat and subsequent residence in non-natal habitat affects growth, emigration timing, and the abundance and stability of adult returns. Non-natal fish (early down-migrants) exhibited more variable growth and more variable but earlier emigration to the estuary than natal fish (late down-migrants). While natal rearing was more common, non-natal fish were overrepresented among adult returns, and total returns were 1.4 times more stable than natal returns alone. Our results demonstrate that variation in migratory behaviour bolsters population stability. However, non-natal rearing is reduced in low water years, suggesting that drought exacerbates population instability by reducing critical intrapopulation variation.},

abstract = {Yearling rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), pumpkinseeds (Lepomis gibbosus), macroinvertebrates, and submersed aquatic plants were sampled at 2- or 3-week intervals from June to October 1979 in a shallow, heavily vegetated embayment in Lake St. Clair to determine whether seasonal changes in plant canopy and plant taxonomic composition affected resource partitioning in these two fish species. In both species, numbers of prey and gut volumes increased with increasing plant canopy until the plant canopy reached a seasonal maximum in mid-summer. Rock bass consumed fewer, larger prey than pumpkinseeds while large Caenidae-Trichoptera-Coenagrionidae, the prey group most preferred by rock bass, was available. Pumpkinseeds ate smaller amphipods, gastropods, and chironomid-lepidopterans that were more abundant numerically than Caenidae-Trichoptera-Coenagrionidae. After mid-summer, the plant canopy declined slowly to one-half of the maximum value, but built-up densities of Hyalella azteca, gastropods, and chironomid-lepidopterans kept availability of prey high throughout late summer. Rock bass shifted to Gammarus, gastropods, and chironomid-lepidopterans as large Caenidae-Trichoptera-Coenagrionidae became scarce. Pumpkinseeds ate more prey in the late season and displayed no prey preference. Their gut volumes peaked in September. Apparently, increasing combined canopy of bushy plants and Heteranthera dubia hindered the foraging of rock bass more than that of pumpkinseeds and caused resource partitioning in the two species. {\textcopyright} 1988, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

abstract = {Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), also known as Pacific whiting, is the most abundant commercial fish species in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem and is an important part of the ecosystem as both predator and prey. A large migratory population occurs off California, Oregon and Washington in the U.S. waters and off British Columbia in Canadian waters. Smaller distinct non-migratory populations of Pacific hake occur in major inlets of the northeast Pacific Ocean, including the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound. The coastal Pacific hake population has supported a fishery averaging 222,000 t per year since 1966. Coastal Pacific hake migrate to northern feeding areas in the summer and southern spawning areas in the winter. The extent of the northern migration and the distribution along the coast are related to the population age and size composition and to varying ocean-climatic conditions, which also influence the growth and location of spawning aggregations. Pacific hake have a lifespan of about 20 years, reach maturity at about 4 years and achieve an average asymptotic size of 53 cm. Coastal Pacific hake are managed under the auspices of a treaty between the United States and Canada, and the two countries jointly conduct acoustic surveys of the resource, stock assessments, stock assessment reviews and management meetings. Prior to the treaty, there were independent and competing stock assessments from the United States and Canada. The Hake Treaty established a default harvest policy, a fixed harvest allocation for each country and a Joint Management Committee that determines the annual coast-wide total allowable catch on the basis of the best available science, the treaty's default harvest policy and input from industry advisors. Regulation and management of the individual fisheries continue to rest within each country. The fishery is executed by four sectors in the United States: vessels that deliver to shore-based processors, vessels that deliver to at-sea processors (mother ships), vessels that both catch and process at-sea (catcher-processors) and a tribal fishery. The Canadian fishery is prosecuted by vessels that deliver to shore-based processors, with a joint-venture mother ship sector in some years. The Pacific hake fishery in the United States and Canada is jointly certified by the Marine Stewardship Council as a sustainable fishery. Pacific hake must be frozen or processed soon after harvest to achieve a marketable product. Currently, most Pacific hake are marketed as fillets or headed and gutted products, although previously a large portion of the harvest was turned into surimi. While none of these products demands a high price, the total revenue to the industry is in tens of millions of U.S. dollars.},

abstract = {We find that a ubiquitous assumption in fisheries models for predicting population replenishment introduces systematic overestimates of replenishment in fished populations. For 32 of the world's major fisheries, these biases result in harvest thresholds being set too high: in most cases, reference points based on spawning potential ratios are more than 2.5 times higher than those necessary to achieve the desired level of replenishment. When we use the more biologically appropriate assumption of reproductive hyperallometry, we find that management tools such as spatiotemporal closures and harvest slots can outperform traditional approaches in terms of yield. Failing to consider reproductive hyperallometry overestimates the efficacy of traditional fisheries management and underestimates the benefits of approaches that create reservoirs of larger individuals.Marine fisheries are an essential component of global food security, but many are close to their limits and some are overfished. The models that guide the management of these fisheries almost always assume reproduction is proportional to mass (isometry), when fecundity generally increases disproportionately to mass (hyperallometry). Judged against several management reference points, we show that assuming isometry overestimates the replenishment potential of exploited fish stocks by 22% (range: 2% to 78%) for 32 of the world's largest fisheries, risking systematic overharvesting. We calculate that target catches based on assumptions of isometry are more than double those based on assumptions of hyperallometry for most species, such that common reference points are set twice as high as they should be to maintain the target level of replenishment. We also show that hyperallometric reproduction provides opportunities for increasing the efficacy of tools that are underused in standard fisheries management, such as protected areas or harvest slot limits. Adopting management strategies that conserve large, hyperfecund fish may, in some instances, result in higher yields relative to traditional approaches. We recommend that future assessment of reference points and quotas include reproductive hyperallometry unless there is clear evidence that it does not occur in that species.All study data are included in the article and/or SI Appendix.},

abstract = {Spatial variation in habitat quality and anthropogenic factors, as well as social structure, can lead to spatially structured populations of animals. Demographic approaches can be used to improve our understanding of the dynamics of spatially structured populations and help identify subpopulations critical for the long-term persistence of regional metapopulations. We provide a regional metapopulation analysis to inform conservation management for Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in five subpopulations defined by land management designations. We used data from an individual-based mark–recapture study to estimate subpopulation sizes, subpopulation growth rates, and movement probabilities among subpopulations. We assessed the source–sink structure of the study population by calculating source–sink statistics, and we created a female-based matrix metapopulation model composed of all subpopulations to examine how variation in demographic components of survival, reproduction, and movement affected metapopulation growth rate. Movement data indicated no subpopulation was completely isolated, but movement probabilities varied among subpopulations. Source–sink statistics and net flow of individuals indicated three subpopulations were sources, while two subpopulations were sinks. We found areas with higher wildlife protection efforts and fewer anthropogenic impacts were sources, and less-protected areas were identified as sinks. Our results highlight the importance of identifying source–sink dynamics among subpopulations for effective conservation planning and emphasize how protected areas can play an important role in sustaining metapopulations.},

abstract = {Fisheries management aims to ensure that the fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term, while also achieving the economic, social and food security related management objectives. To facilitate this, both the ecological and human dimensions of sustainability need to be included in fisheries assessment. In addition, assessing long-term sustainability calls for taking into account plausible changes in the surrounding societal conditions that shape the characteristics of the fisheries governance system, as well as the ecological conditions. The paper uses a combination of qualitative exploratory scenario storylines (ESS) and Bayesian belief networks (BBN) to integrate the environmental, economic, social and food security dimensions in an interdisciplinary assessment of the future sustainability of Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras, Clupeidae) and salmon (Salmo salar, Salmonidae) fisheries. First, four alternative ESS were created based on plausible changes in societal drivers. The ESS were then formulated into a BBN to (a) visualize the assumed causalities, and (b) examine quantitatively how changes in the societal drivers affect the social-ecological fisheries system and ultimately the fisheries management objectives. This type of probabilistic scenario synthesis can help in thinking qualitative scenarios in a quantitative way. Moreover, it can increase understanding on the causal links between societal driving forces and the complex fisheries system and on how the management objectives can be achieved, thereby providing valuable information for strategic decision-making under uncertainty.},

abstract = {After near extinction as a result of the fur trade in the 1700s and 1800s, the southern sea otter slowly reoccupied the core of its range in central California. Range expansion beyond central California is seen as key to full recovery of otters, but the rate of expansion has been sporadic, raising concerns about habitat quality in southern California. To describe the range expansion of sea otters from central into southern California, we used skiff surveys, aerial surveys, and archival time-depth recorders from 2004 to 2013. These observations show that range expansion began when male otters swam southeast of Point Conception (Cojo Anchorage), perhaps to seek refuge from bad weather and to feed on unexploited resources. After several years of seasonal use by male groups, females began to use the area, leading to reproduction and a secondary increase in abundance. In contrast, a second male group that moved farther down the coast to Coal Oil Point stalled and retreated. Such range expansion and contraction can be explained by the social nature of sea otters, which acts to slow dispersal away from groups. Otter densities at Cojo Anchorage are now approaching equilibrium levels reported for central California. As in central California, otters rested in and near kelp forest habitat, but used deeper water for foraging. Together, these observations suggest habitat in the Santa Barbara Channel can still support sea otters, but range expansion of otters into southern California will be episodic due to social dynamics.

SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Quantitative models have been used extensively to solve complex problems in sea otter conservation. Models represent powerful tools for simplifying and integrating data across a wide range of topics, from behavior and physiology to complex population dynamics, genetics, disease ecology, food-web interactions, and physical/biological oceanography. When based on solid data and sound assumptions, models allow scientists to test hypotheses, elucidate the underlying mechanisms of a particular problem, and make sound conservation decisions. Here I discuss several branches of conservation science in which sea otter researchers have used mathematical models to aid in their research, including behavior, population dynamics, community interactions, and applied conservation questions. For each subject area, I explain some of the key research questions, provide examples of how models have been used to help answer those questions, and highlight promising areas for future and ongoing work in sea otter conservation. Finally I explore some of the general lessons that can be drawn from these examples, focusing on points that may be useful for wildlife conservation more broadly.},

abstract = {Much empirical work has examined whether foraging animals distribute themselves across patches of resources according to an ideal free distribution (IFD). Most studies consider situations with 2 patches, where choice of one patch is synonymous,vith rejection of the alternative. In this paper, we use computer simulations to determine the effect of the number of patches on achievement of an IFD, Identical foragers were allowed to move between patches so as to maximize their intake rate. To generate departures from an IFD, we assigned all foragers a perception Limit of prey numbers such that they could not perceive differences in patch quality that exceed this limit. Foragers would choose randomly from the patches among which they could perceive no differences. We found that, for the same perception limit, departures from an IFD were greatest in the 2-patch situation. In addition, we are less likely to detect perception limit-generated deviations from an IFD (or even a random distribution) in greater than 2-patch situations unless He examine cases in which there are large among-patch differences in quality. Hence, lab and field studies that incorporate the greater realism achieved by using more than 2 patches must be cautious about falsely accepting the hypothesis of an IFD, particularly if the causes of deviations from an IFD are independent of the number of patches. We review published studies and find that conformity to an IFD seems to decrease with an increase in the number of patches. Hence, if deviations from an IFD are perception-induced, discrimination may decrease with the number of patches, presumably because of the increasing physical and computational difficulties of keeping track of each patch.},

abstract = {Abstract Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are an ecologically, commercially, and culturally important Alaskan groundfish species. Commercial harvest of halibut dates back to the late 19th century and has been managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) since 1921. IPHC surveys have revealed declining trends in survey biomass in multiple regions and region-specific declines in mean size-at-age (size-at-age) over the past two decades (>50% in some areas). Changes in size-at-age can arise from a variety of physical, ecological, sampling, and fishery effects, including size-dependent fishery or predation mortality, alteration in growth from variability in prey quality or quantity, and changes in temperature-dependent metabolic demands. Here, we develop and apply a bioenergetics model for halibut using survey-based diet and temperature data for Alaska to evaluate potential environmental drivers of size-at-age. In general, juvenile (<40 cm fork length) foraging rates were highest in the Gulf of Alaska concomitant with higher potential growth and elevated basal metabolic demands during warm summer conditions. In contrast, adult (40?120 cm FL) potential growth was highest in the Eastern Bering Sea, potentially reflecting lower metabolic costs and higher rates of prey consumption in that region. We additionally find evidence for interannual variation in potential growth, with a higher frequency of reduced growth potential in the last decade, particularly in the Eastern Bering Sea in 2015 and 2016 for both juvenile and adult halibut. These results suggest the potential for patterns in size-at-age to arise from trophic and environmental constraints that collectively limit growth in some regions and years.},

abstract = {Metapopulations are often managed as a single contiguous population despite the spatial structure underlying their local and regional dynamics. Disturbances from human activities can also be spatially structured with mortality impacts concentrated to just a few local populations among the aggregate. Scale transitions between local and regional processes can generate emergent properties whereby the whole system can fail to recover as quickly as expected for an equivalent single population. Here, we draw on theory and empirical case studies to ask: what is the consequence of spatially structured ecological and disturbance processes on metapopulation recoveries? We suggest that exploring this question could help address knowledge gaps for managing metapopulations including: Why do some metapopulations recover quickly while others remain collapsed? And, what risks are unaccounted for when metapopulations are managed at aggregate scales? First, we used model simulations to examine how scale transitions among ecological and disturbance conditions interact to generate emergent metapopulation recovery outcomes. In general, we found that the spatial structure of disturbance was a strong determinant of recovery outcomes. Specifically, disturbances that unevenly impacted local populations consistently generated the slowest recoveries and highest conservation risks. Ecological conditions that dampened metapopulation recoveries included low dispersal, variable local demography, sparsely connected habitat networks, and spatially and temporally correlated stochastic processes. Second, we illustrate the unexpected challenges of managing metapopulations by examining the recoveries of three USA federally listed endangered species: Florida Everglade snail kites, California and Alaska sea otters, and Snake River Chinook salmon. Overall, our results show the pivotal role of spatial structure in metapopulation recoveries whereby the interplay between local and regional processes shapes the resilience of the whole system. With this understanding, we provide guidelines for resource managers tasked with conserving and managing metapopulations and identify opportunities for research to support the application of metapopulation theory to real-world challenges.},

Large fish showed 100% survival regardless of feeding regime. In years of large, prolonged runoff that delays the seasonal warming of the upper Colorado River, late spawning by Colorado squawfish leaves age-0 fish with only 2 months to grow and accumulate fat reserves before the onset of winter.

abstract = {A challenge in implementing biodiversity conservation is in reconciling criteria for identifying significant areas and representative networks for biodiversity protection. Many international environmental initiatives include biological, ecological, economic, social and governance criteria to aid selection of areas for biodiversity conservation. Here we reviewed criteria used by 15 international initiatives, and what minimum set of biodiversity variables would be needed to support them. From a range of ecological and biological criteria, we identified eight criteria commonly used to identify areas for biodiversity conservation across these initiatives. Four criteria identified areas that (1) contained unique and rare habitats; (2) included fragile and sensitive habitats; (3) were important for ecological integrity; and (4) were representative of all habitats. Another four criteria were based on species' attributes, including (5) the presence of species of conservation concern; (6) the occurrence of restricted-range species; (7) species richness; and (8) importance for life history stages. Information required to inform these criteria include: habitat cover, species occurrence, species richness, species' geographic range and population abundance. This synthesized set of ecological and biological criteria, and their biodiversity variables will simplify the process to identify additional areas of high biodiversity significance, that in turn support achieving the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) targets to fill gaps in the representativeness of the global coverage of protected areas.},

When survival was low (1988), density declined linearly for up to 6.5 km downstream. When survival rates were highest (1989), densities appeared to be at carrying capacity for up to 3.5 km below the stocking site; densities farther downstream declined linearly, and the maximum dispersal distance was 10.9 km. Mean weight of young-of-the-year (age-0) fish was density dependent, and overwinter survival was contingent upon the fish achieving a threshold weight. As density of age-0 fish increased (among sites), the density of fish achieving the threshold weight or larger increased to a maximum. Fluctuations in survival between years and streams were probably caused by variable mortality associated with transportation and stocking and by factors such as high water temperature and flooding.},

In this model both growth and recruitment rates can depend on either the number of individuals of specific sizes in the population or the level of food available. Necessary conditions for values of fishing pressure and size limit that maximize the present value of the resource are obtained and are interpreted in economic terms. The general solution obtained here reduces to solutions obtained previously for some special cases: the single age-class model, and the linear age-dependent model. Solutions involving constant fishery policy are sought for several different, specific versions of the general model. In each of these versions a constant policy solution is not optimal. This implies that for a general, realistic model the policy that maximizes present value is a time-varying or "pulse fishing" policy. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed in the light of existing results. {\textcopyright} 1981 Springer-Verlag.},

A secondary working hypothesis was that reproductive loss to kittiwake nest predators was greatest during years of reduced prey availability. We report on a broad-scale, integrated study of kittiwakes and their prey in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Our study spanned five breeding seasons (1995-1999) and focused on three colonies that differed in size (ranging from ca. 220 to ca. 7000 breeding pairs) and proximity to each other (50-135 km apart). Kittiwakes in PWS encountered a variety of aquatic habitats, creating a complex foraging environment for breeding birds. We measured kittiwake reproductive success and foraging activities, while simultaneously measuring the abundance of surface schooling forage fishes throughout the foraging range of breeding kittiwakes. The abundance of primary prey species for kittiwakes (Pacific herring Clupea pallasi, Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus, and capelin Mallotus villosus) varied both annually and regionally, with no one region consistently having the greatest abundance of prey. Likewise, kittiwake reproductive success varied considerably among colonies and years. We found that bottom-up, top-down, timing mismatch, and colony-specific effects were all important to kittiwake productivity. Although bottom-up effects appeared to be strongest, they were not evident in some cases until other effects, such as geographic location (proximity of colony to prey concentrations) and top-down predation, were considered. Important bottom-up effects on kittiwake reproductive success were not only total prey abundance and distribution, but also species, age composition, and chronology of prey occurrence (match/mismatch of timing with critical brood-rearing periods); these effects varied by colony. Top-down effects of predation on kittiwake nest contents (independent of prey abundance) confounded seabird-forage fish relationships. Ultimately, when confounding factors were minimized, non-linear asymptotic relationships were identified between kittiwakes and their prey, with an asymptotic threshold of fish school surface area density of ca. 5 m2/km2, beyond which top-down, physiological, or phylogenetic constraints likely restrict further reproductive output. The integrated approach of our investigations provided a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying predator-prey relationships in the complex marine environment. However, such mechanistic theories can only be tested and refined through long-term research and monitoring of much greater duration than the 5-year study reported herein. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Biological reference points (BRPs) are widely used to define safe levels of harvesting for marine fish populations. Most BRPs are either minimum acceptable biomass levels or maximum fishing mortality rates. The values of BRPs are determined from historical abundance data and the life-history parameters of the fish species. However, when the life-history parameters change over time, the BRPs become moving targets. In particular, the natural mortality rate of prey species depends on predator levels; conversely, predator growth rates depend on prey availability. We tested a suite of BRPs for their robustness to observed changes in natural mortality and growth rates. We used the relatively simple Baltic Sea fish community for this sensitivity test, with cod as predator and sprat and herring as prey. In general, the BRPs were much more sensitive to the changes in natural mortality rates than to growth variation. For a prey species like sprat, fishing mortality reference levels should be conditioned on the level of predation mortality. For a predator species, a conservative level of fishing mortality can be identified that will prevent growth overfishing and ensure stock replacement. These first-order multispecies interactions should be considered when defining BRPs for medium-term (5–10 year) management decisions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Invasive macrophytes drive substantial changes to freshwater fish habitats. Such changes can influence how fish select for habitats, but fish–habitat relationships in many invasive macrophytes are often poorly understood at micro-scales. Fish habitat use is influenced by dissolved oxygen (DO) and habitat complexity, but this response can be nonlinear and dependent upon fish density. This study tested whether microhabitat use of sunfish (Lepomis spp.) in invasive macrophyte beds was density-dependent. Fish were sampled with underwater video point counts in six 0.405 ha experimental ponds with surface-matted hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata and stocked with varying densities of sunfishes. Regression models were used to evaluate the key drivers for fish habitat selection across DO, complexity and fish densities. Both fish occurrence and fish counts were positively influenced by DO and negatively influenced by habitat complexity, but the fish counts-DO relationship was dome-shaped and both fish occurrence and counts depended upon fish densities. For example, at high fish densities, fish used low and high DO and high macrophyte complexity; at low fish densities, fish avoided such areas. Fish counts peaked at intermediate DO and low macrophyte complexity. Density-dependent fish habitat selection appeared to mitigate detrimental effects of invasive macrophytes on fish habitats, indicating that fish can and do use ‘inhospitable' habitats with potential positive population growth. Understanding density-dependent habitat selection is needed when evaluating the quality of habitats, as apparently inhospitable habitats can be utilized when fish density is high.},

Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Abstract The ?area?heterogeneity tradeoff? hypothesis predicts unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on species richness, implying that habitats with intermediate heterogeneity may be priority for spatial protection. Alternatively, if heterogeneity effects are positive, then protecting the most heterogeneous habitats may take precedence. We tested for unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on the species density (area-corrected richness) of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.): long-lived, benthic fishes vulnerable to overexploitation. Inconsistent with predictions, topographic structural complexity had a strong linear effect on species density; other heterogeneity measures had weaker, positive effects and the only unimodal effect (depth range) was weak. The clear implication is that, to protect the highest density of rockfish species, marine protected areas should include the most topographically complex substrates. Our results can also help refine and test species distribution models needed to inform spatial planning where in situ surveys are lacking. The area?heterogeneity tradeoff generates useful predictions for which support may be context-dependent.},

abstract = {Global conversion of natural habitats to agriculture has led to marked changes in species diversity and composition. However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species. Networks of feeding interactions (food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function. Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps. The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans.},

It addresses the problem of resource model identification, that is, the question: Which of various competing models correctly describes the resource? A major theme of the paper is the proposition that data uncertainty and model ambiguity are fundamentally intertwined. In some cases this relationship can be proved rigorously; consequently, model ambiguity can be inevitable. In other cases, promising identification techniques are suggested by modern statistical theory, and the paper examines some of these in the context of time series analysis. Throughout the paper, theoretical and practical examples illustrate both limitations and possibilities for using resource models as valid descriptors of reality.},

These techniques have potential application to the initial surveys of candidate habitats for Marine Protected Areas, and to the subsequent monitoring necessary to manage them. Remote video techniques can be used in shelf depths beyond the limits of diver-based Underwater Visual Census (UVC), and stereo-video systems can also be used to complement and enhance normal UVC by allowing very precise and accurate estimates of fish morphometrics (and hence weight). Some video techniques are very cost-effective and can help remove some major sources of observer bias in underwater observations, by removing the need for skilled observers in the field and by allowing simultaneous collection of a much wider suite of information in a permanent record that can be analysed later. This medium is directly accessible to an unlimited audience. Baited, remote video techniques offer a non-intrusive, depth-independent assessment tool with the advantages of both diver-based observation and capture techniques, but appropriate sampling statistics must be developed if relative abundance is to be measured adequately.},

A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: "cool" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and again from 1947-1976, while "warm" PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations-at a range of varying time scales-can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities-one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years-the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

abstract = {While much of traditional fisheries theory has concentrated on maximum or optimum yield, the reality of fisheries management is that biomass yield is only one of the several indicators of fisheries performance, and desired outcomes generally only need to provide something near the maximum possible yield. A range of policies are explored to find those that produce "Pretty Good Yield" defined as sustainable yield at least 80% of the maximum sustainable yield. Such yields are generally obtained over a broad range of stock sizes (20-50% of unfished stock abundance), and this range is not sensitive to the population's basic life history parameters such as natural mortality rate, somatic growth rate, or age at maturity. The most important biological parameter determining this range is the intensity of recruitment compensation. Meta-analysis shows compensation is usually strong and there is reasonably little yield lost at what are now widely accepted definitions of overfishing or risk for most stocks. Similarly, maintaining stocks at 50% of unfished stock abundance for ecological or economic reasons results in little expected loss of yield. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The extent and rate of harvest-induced genetic changes in natural populations may impact population productivity, recovery, and persistence. While there is substantial evidence for phenotypic changes in harvested fishes, knowledge of genetic change in the wild remains limited, as phenotypic and genetic data are seldom considered in tandem, and the number of generations needed for genetic changes to occur is not well understood. We quantified changes in size-at-age, sex-specific changes in body size, and genomic metrics in three harvested walleye (Sander vitreus) populations and a fourth reference population with low harvest levels over a 15-year period in Mistassini Lake, Quebec. We also collected Indigenous knowledge (IK) surrounding concerns about these populations over time. Using $\sim$9,000 SNPs, genomic metrics included changes in population structure, neutral genomic diversity, effective population size, and signatures of selection. Indigenous knowledge revealed overall reductions in body size and number of fish caught. Smaller body size, a small reduction in size-at-age, nascent changes to population structure (population differentiation within one river and homogenization between two others), and signatures of selection between historical and contemporary samples reflected coupled phenotypic and genomic change in the three harvested populations in both sexes, while no change occurred in the reference population. Sex-specific analyses revealed differences in both body size and genomic metrics but were inconclusive about whether one sex was disproportionately affected. Although alternative explanations cannot be ruled out, our collective results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic changes associated with harvesting may arise within 1–2.5 generations in long-lived wild fishes. This study thus demonstrates the need to investigate concerns about harvest-induced evolution quickly once they have been raised.},

abstract = {The recovery of large carnivore species from over-exploitation can have socioecological effects; thus, reliable estimates of potential abundance and distribution represent a valuable tool for developing management objectives and recovery criteria. For sea otters (Enhydra lutris), as with many apex predators, equilibrium abundance is not constant across space but rather varies as a function of local habitat quality and resource dynamics, thereby complicating the extrapolation of carrying capacity (K) from one location to another. To overcome this challenge, we developed a state-space model of density-dependent population dynamics in southern sea otters (E. l. nereis), in which K is estimated as a continuously varying function of a suite of physical, biotic, and oceanographic variables, all described at fine spatial scales. We used a theta-logistic process model that included environmental stochasticity and allowed for density-independent mortality associated with shark bites. We used Bayesian methods to fit the model to time series of survey data, augmented by auxiliary data on cause of death in stranded otters. Our model results showed that the expected density at K for a given area can be predicted based on local bathymetry (depth and distance from shore), benthic substrate composition (rocky vs. soft sediments), presence of kelp canopy, net primary productivity, and whether or not the area is inside an estuary. In addition to density-dependent reductions in growth, increased levels of shark-bite mortality over the last decade have also acted to limit population expansion. We used the functional relationships between habitat variables and equilibrium density to project estimated values of K for the entire historical range of southern sea otters in California, USA, accounting for spatial variation in habitat quality. Our results suggest that California could eventually support 17,226 otters (95% CrI = 9,739–30,087). We also used the fitted model to compute candidate values of optimal sustainable population abundance (OSP) for all of California and for regions within California. We employed a simulation-based approach to determine the abundance associated with the maximum net productivity level (MNPL) and propose that the upper quartile of the distribution of MNPL estimates (accounting for parameter uncertainty) represents an appropriate threshold value for OSP. Based on this analysis, we suggest a candidate value for OSP (for all of California) of 10,236, which represents 59.4% of projected K. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {“Super-blooms” of cyanobacteria that produce potent and environmentally persistent biotoxins (microcystins) are an emerging global health issue in freshwater habitats. Monitoring of the marine environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine “harmful algal bloom” in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface.},

abstract = {The endemic avifauna of Wallacea is of high conservation significance, but remains poorly studied. Identifying priority conservation areas requires a greater understanding of the habitat associations of these bird communities, and of how spatial scale of analysis can influence the interpretation of these associations. This study aims to determine which proxy habitat measures, at which spatial scales of analysis, can provide useful inferential data on the composition of Wallacean forest avifauna. Research was conducted within the Lambusango forest reserve, South-East Sulawesi, using point count surveys to sample avifauna. Habitat properties were characterised in three ways: broad classification of forest type, canopy remotely-sensed response derived from satellite imagery, and in situ measures of vegetation composition and structure. Furthermore, we examined avifauna-habitat relationships at three spatial scales: area (c.400 ha per sample site), transect (c.10 ha) and point (c.0.2 ha). Results demonstrate that broad forest type classifications at an area scale can help to determine conservation value, indicating that primary and old secondary forests are important for supporting many species with lower ecological tolerances, such as large-bodied frugivores. At the transect-scale, significant congruence occurs between bird community composition and several habitat variables derived from vegetation sampling and satellite imagery, particularly tree size, undergrowth density, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values; this highlights the importance small scale habitat associations can have on determining $\alpha$-diversity. Analysis at the point-scale was ineffective in providing proxy indications for avifauna. These findings should be considered when determining future priority conservation areas for Wallacean avifauna. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stream conservation and restoration strategies commonly focus on preserving extant riparian forest and restoring riparian habitat. Though these practices are beneficial to stream habitat, they may not suffice to restore stream condition in catchments heavily influenced by intensive land use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured invertebrate populations in 12 streams affected by different land-use types (cultivated, developed, forested and grassland). Within each stream, we compared reaches with and without riparian buffers of remnant mature forest. Within each reach, we calculated the relative abundance of individuals from the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and assessed specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and substratum composition. Forested catchments had the highest %EPT (average 23.8) followed by grassland (16.1), cultivated (1.96) and developed (0.31). Reaches with forested buffers present were not associated with higher %EPT in forested, cultivated or developed catchments. In grassland catchments, however, %EPT was about eightfold higher in reaches with forested buffers than those without. High values of %EPT were associated with large stream substratum and low specific conductance and temperature, which were most common in forested catchments. Developed and cultivated catchments did not follow this pattern, %EPT being uniformly low, even where abiotic conditions were similar to forested catchments. These results confirm that intensive urban and cultivated land uses at the catchment scale degrade stream biological communities. They also indicate that patchy forested riparian corridors, as found in many restoration projects, are probably insufficient to mitigate severe, large-scale biological degradation. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

abstract = {Abstract
State–space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture–recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. We present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in‐depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

abstract = {This study characterized the toxicity and physiological effects of unweathered diluted bitumen (Access Western Blend dilbit; AWB) to fish. Embryos of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were exposed for 17 days to dilutions of physically-dispersed (water accommodated fraction; WAF) and chemically-dispersed (chemically-enhanced WAF; CEWAF) dilbit. AWB dilbit exposure was not lethal to medaka, but resulted in a high prevalence of blue sac disease (BSD), impaired development, and abnormal or un-inflated swim bladders at hatch. Physiological effects were indicated by the relative mRNA levels of key genes associated with, among others, cell cycling and the response to mutations (p53), xenobiotic metabolism (ahr, arnt2), phase I (cyp1a) and II processes associated with oxidative stress (cat, g6pdh, hsp70, gst, gpx, gsr, nfe2, and sod). AWB dilbit treatment increased p53 and cyp1a transcript levels (1.5-fold and >15-fold, respectively), with significant, but less pronounced changes in indicators of oxidative stress and metabolism. The exposure-related changes in embryotoxicity and mRNA synthesis were consistent with metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to reactive and toxic metabolites. Medaka embryos responded similarly to WAF and CEWAF treatments, but CEWAF was about 100 times more efficient in delivering toxic concentrations of PAHs. The toxicity of chemically-dispersed nujol, a non-toxic mineral oil used as an experimental control, suggested that a portion of the observed effects of AWB could be attributed to excess dispersant in solution. This first study of the physiological effects of dilbit toxicity to fish embryos provides a baseline to compare toxicity between dilbit and conventional crude oils, and the groundwork for the development of molecular biomarkers of the sensitivity and level of risk of native Canadian fish species to dilbit exposure.},

abstract = {Species richness records from replicated deployments of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) and unbaited remote underwater video stations (UBRUVS) in shallow (<1 m) and deep (>1 m) water were compared with those obtained from using fyke nets, gillnets and beach seines. Maximum species richness (14 species) was achieved through a combination of conventional netting and camera-based techniques. Chanos chanos was the only species not recorded on camera, whereas Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Selenotoca multifasciata and Gerres filamentosus were recorded on camera in all three waterholes but were not detected by netting. BRUVSs and UBRUVSs provided versatile techniques that were effective at a range of depths and microhabitats. It is concluded that cameras warrant application in aquatic areas of high conservation value with high visibility. Non-extractive video methods are particularly desirable where threatened species are a focus of monitoring or might be encountered as by-catch in net meshes.},

abstract = {Biological populations are susceptible to random variation in environmental influences such as temperature and moisture. This variability (or noise) can determine population size and, ultimately, cause extinctions. Extinction risk depends on noise colour or the amount of short- and long-term variation. Most environmental noise is reddened: the variation is dominated by long-term fluctuations. Recent modelling has shown that moderately reddened noise affects populations differently from the white noise used in earlier studies. However, some geophysical phenomena, such as temperature and river height, can have deeply reddened 'brown' or even 'black' spectra. We find that, compared to environments characterized by red noise, very long population persistence times are more likely for black noise. Unlike previous work incorporating a simple autoregressive model of reddened noise, our model suggests that the large variation associated with persistence in a red-noise environment limits our ability to predict the fate of particular populations subject to this noise colour. Thus, we identify the colour of noise experienced by a population - red or black - as a crucial factor in any attempt to manage or conserve that population.},

abstract = {The study of the relevant scales for use in landscape biodiversity management involves several difficulties, like small sample sizes at large scales and varying trends between species. I studied richness in a pool of 25 bird species in relation to the amounts and coverage proportions of four forest habitats over eight scales based on data from forty-two 10 km transects. By adding habitat amounts from the transects, the accumulated species pool flattened out when about 400 ha of older forest was included. Transect pooling gave plot sizes that reflected plots ranging in size 10-80 km2, and the correlation's between bird species richness and the proportions of two good and two poor habitats were calculated at eight scales. For three of the habitat proportions, respectively, species richness was significantly influenced only at the smallest scale (10 km2), while for old forest also at 20 km2. These regressions changed slopes (positive or negative) from the smaller to the larger scales for three of the habitats. However, in areas of 10 km2 bird diversity was significantly predicted (positive or negative) by the proportion of any single habitat (suitable or poor), while in areas of 20-80 km2 it was not, which may suggest that to reach comparably high levels of species richness in large areas, a mixture of several habitats is decisive. Thus, management of forest bird diversity may not be efficient over broad areas if the proportions of only one or a few habitats are used. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Relationships between SAA occupancy and detection probabilities, environmental variables, and management effects were examined in 141 randomly selected perennial streams in commercial forests west of the Cascade Crest in Oregon and Washington from July to October, 2006. Giant salamander occupancy varied by stream substrate type (i.e., consolidated vs. unconsolidated geologies) and was positively associated with stand age. Torrent salamander occupancy varied by species, was positively associated with channel gradient, and was reduced in the youngest and oldest sampled stands. Tailed frog occupancy was negatively associated with the presence of crayfish, negatively associated with low and high bankfull widths, and positively associated with stand age, although stands less than 5 years old had occupancy rates >50% in the absence of crayfish. Mean detection rates were less than 1 for all three genera (0.85, 0.66, and 0.63 for Dicamptodon, Rhyacotriton, and Ascaphus, respectively), which indicates that conclusions from previous research about relationships between SAA occupancy, environmental variables, and forest practices have an unknown element of uncertainty, particularly if detection rates co-vary with habitat change. We believe that our study is the first to present unbiased estimates of occupancy and detection parameters for SAA on forested landscapes in Oregon and Washington. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding how fishing effort responds to management interventions is important for conserving threatened fisheries resources such as the European eel (Anguilla anguilla). In this paper, we use a discrete choice survey to predict the allocation of recreational angling days directed at eel versus potential substitute fishing opportunities in northern Germany as a function of eel angling regulations, catch attributes and hypothetical eel fishing costs. We found the allocation model to accurately predict current eel effort allocation patterns. Using the validated statistical model as a forecasting tool, we found eel angling effort to be largely resilient to changes in individual eel angling regulations, including daily bag limits, daily rod limits and fishery closures for up to two weeks each month. An inelastic effort response to the most commonly discussed policy interventions suggests that managers cannot expect to substantially reduce eel fishing effort, and thus mortality exerted by anglers on eel, using moderate management interventions. However, when severe regulations, including a two week closure per month, with remaining days limited to a harvest of 1 eel, 60. cm or larger, per angler using a single rod, would be implemented, angling effort devoted to eel can be expected to be reduced by about 42% relative to current conditions at unaltered expected catches. This would reduce landings of eel by anglers by 73%. This reduction in landings has unknown effects on the future recruitment of eel while at the same time substantially reducing angler welfare. Angler welfare can be largely maintained by increases in minimum-size limits and reductions in daily bag limits, while at the same time reducing eel landings by anglers substantially. Such actions are therefore preferred from an angler welfare perspective. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Although the capacity of individuals to adapt to climate change is a function of their access to resources, the adaptive capacity of societies depends on the ability to act collectively in the face of the threats posed by climate variability and change. Thus adaptive capacity, as an element of overall vulnerability of a society, can be illuminated through examining the institutions for resource management and their effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy. I argue that the social capital constitutes social aspects of adaptive capacity. Social capital is made up of the networks and relationships between individuals and social groups that facilitate economic well-being and security. Indeed I demonstrate that social capital is an important element for coping with climate variability and hazard in the present day. The paper concludes with challenges for research to bring social aspects such as legitimacy and equity to the heart of the analysis of adaptation.},

On the west coast of Canada, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) supported an intensive reduction fishery from the early 1930s until the collapse of all five major stocks in the late 1960s, which then recovered rapidly following a fishery closure. Despite conservative harvests, abundance has declined again recently, with little evidence of recovery. We investigated the effect of bottom-up forcing by zooplankton abundance, top-down forcing by fish and mammal predators, and the effects of sardine abundance as potential competitors on the natural mortality of the herring stock on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Herring mortality was positively related to Thysanoessa spinifera and southern chaetognaths and negatively to pteropod abundance. Estimated predation on herring decreased significantly during the years 1973–2008, with the main consumers changing from fish to mammals. However, the correlation with herring mortality was negative, whereas there was a significant positive relationship with sardine abundance. Population recovery is expected to be facilitated by a combination of factors, including adequate food supply, limited or reduced predation (including fishing), and limited competition particularly for wasp–waist systems, where different forage species may occupy similar niches.},

From the end of the nineteenth century to the present, modern extinctions varied by decade but significantly increased after 1950 (post-1950s mean = 7.5 extinct taxa per decade). In the twentieth century, freshwater fishes had the highest extinction rate worldwide among vertebrates. The modern extinction rate for North American freshwater fishes is conservatively estimated to be 877 times greater than the background extinction rate for freshwater fishes (one extinction every 3 million years). Reasonable estimates project that future increases in extinctions will range from 53 to 86 species by 2050.},

abstract = {A central assumption of life history theory is that the evolution of the component traits is determined in part by trade-offs between these traits. Whereas the existence of such trade-offs has been well demonstrated, the relative importance of these remains unclear. In this paper we use optimality theory to test the hypothesis that the trade-off between present and future fecundity induced by the costs of continued growth is a sufficient explanation for the optimal age at first reproduction, alpha, and the optimal allocation to reproduction, G, in 38 populations of perch and Arctic char. This hypothesis is rejected for both traits and we conclude that this trade-off, by itself, is an insufficient explanation for the observed values of alpha and G. Similarly, a fitness function that assumes a mortality cost to reproduction but no growth cost cannot account for the observed values of alpha. In contrast, under the assumption that fitness is maximized, the observed life histories can be accounted for by the joint action of trade-offs between growth and reproductive allocation and between mortality and reproductive allocation (Individual Juvenile Mortality model). Although the ability of the growth/mortality model to fit the data does not prove that this is the mechanism driving the evolution of the optimal age at first reproduction and allocation to reproduction, the fit does demonstrate that the hypothesis is consistent with the data and hence cannot at this time be rejected. We also examine two simpler versions of this model, one in which adult mortality is a constant proportion of juvenile mortality [Proportional Juvenile Mortality (PJM) model] and one in which the proportionality is constant within but not necessarily between species [Specific Juvenile Mortality (SSJM) model]. We find that the PJM model is unacceptable but that the SSJM model produces fits suggesting that, within the two species studied, juvenile mortality is proportional to adult mortality but the value differs between the two species.},

Pink salmon eggs were incubated in water that became contaminated with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) after percolating through gravel coated with weathered oil. Weathering ensured that the PAH composition of the water was dominated by alkyl-substituted naphthalenes and larger compounds. Most survivors of the exposures appeared healthy, and were released to the marine environment with coded-wire tags. Their survival was evaluated when they returned at maturity 2 yr later. Other survivors, also healthy in appearance, were retained in net pens to measure delayed effects on growth during the early juvenile stage. Pink salmon exposed to an initial concentration of total PAH equal to 5.4 ppb experienced a 15 % decrease in marine survival compared to unexposed salmon. A delayed effect on growth was measured in juvenile salmon that survived embryonic exposure to doses as low as 18 ppb PAH. Reductions in juvenile growth could account for the reduced marine survival observed in the released fish. The demonstration of delayed effects on growth and survival support claims of delayed effects in pink salmon after the 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill, and indicate the potential for population-level effects resulting from embryonic exposure to oil.},

First passed in 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Act fosters long-term biological and economic sustainability of our nation's marine fisheries out to 200 nautical miles from shore. Key objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Act are to: Prevent overfishing Rebuild overfished stocks Increase long-term economic and social benefits Ensure a safe and sustainable supply of seafood Prior to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, waters beyond 12 nautical miles were international waters and fished by fleets from other countries. The 1976 law extended U.S. jurisdiction to 200 nautical miles and established eight regional fishery management councils (Councils) with representation from the coastal states and fishery stakeholders. The Councils' primary responsibility is development of fishery management plans (FMPs). These FMPs must comply with a number of conservation and management requirements, including the 10 National Standards—principles that promote sustainable fisheries management. Congress has twice made significant revisions to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, first in 1996 with the passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act, and in 2007 with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, U.S. fisheries management is a transparent and robust process of science, management, innovation, and collaboration with the fishing industry. A scientific analysis of the abundance and composition of a fish stock (stock assessment) evaluates the stock to determine if the stock status is subject to overfishing or overfished. Using this scientific data, Councils set annual catch limits, and if they are exceeded in a fishing year, accountability measures pre-determine the mechanism to respond. Since 2011, our domestic fisheries have had measures in place to meet the new requirements, and today, more than 90 percent of fisheries are maintaining harvest levels below their annual catch limits. As a result of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the United States is ending and preventing overfishing in federally-managed fisheries, actively rebuilding stocks, and providing fishing opportunities and economic benefits for both commercial and recreational fishermen as well as fishing communities and shoreside businesses that support fishing and use fish products.},

However, estimating recruitment in a stock assessment model involves the challenging task of identifying a self-sustaining population, which often includes representing complex geographic structure. A review of several case studies demonstrated that alternative stock assessment models can influence estimates of recruitment. Incorporating spatial population structure and connectivity into stock assessment models changed the perception of recruitment events for a wide diversity of fisheries, but the degree to which estimates were impacted depended on movement rates and relative stock sizes. For multiple population components, estimates of strong recruitment events and the productivity of smaller population units were often more sensitive to connectivity assumptions. Simulation testing, conditioned on these case studies, suggested that accurately accounting for population structure, either in management unit definitions or stock assessment model structure, improved recruitment estimates. An understanding of movement dynamics improved estimation of connected sub-populations. The challenge of representing geographic structure in stock assessment emphasizes the importance of defining self-sustaining management units to justify a unit-stock assumption.},

Most studies of fisheries-induced evolution have focused on changes in sexual maturation using the probabilistic maturation reaction norm method, which requires specific information on the age at which maturation occurs, often derived from macroscopic examination of the gonads. In the absence of sufficiently detailed measurements of maturity it is necessary to derive estimates of the age at which maturation occurs from alternative sources of information, for example, from length at age data. We apply a relatively simple segmented regression model to length at age data for plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the Irish Sea in order to identify the change-point between 2 specific growth schedules that can be used as a proxy for age at first maturity in individual cohorts. We use a Bayesian approach for model fitting and map the resulting distribution of change-points using Gaussian mixture models to show that the age at which the change-point occurred in individual cohorts of both male and female plaice in the Irish Sea has declined progressively over an 18 yr period between 1988 and 2005.},

I compared data on temperature, food abundance, stream flow, cover and population density with movements and conducted field and laboratory tests to determine reasons for the two types of movements. Smolts of the anadromous species migrated for an obvious reason but none of the factors I examined appeared to “stimulate or release” their seaward migration. Movement frequently coincided with changes in water temperature and stream flow, but I could not establish a consistent causal relationship and concluded that photoperiod and perhaps growth must initiate the physiological and behavioral changes associated with seaward migration. Non-anadromous and pre-smolt anadromous species emigrated from the streams for different reasons than the smolts. I postulated that fish found the stream environment unsuitable during the winter. Stream temperature declined in the fall as fish began moving from the streams but I could not induce more fish to stay in test troughs with 12 C water versus troughs with 0–10 C water. Fish emigrated before abundance of drift insects declined in winter. Emigration occurred in spite of the relatively stable flows in both streams. Population density modified the basic migration pattern by regulating the number and percentage of fish that emigrated and to a limited extent time of emigration. Movements of non-smolt trout and salmon correlated best with the amount of cover provided by large rubble substrate. Subyearling trout emigrated from Big Springs Creek which contained no rubble substrate but remained in the Lemhi River which did. In both field and laboratory tests more fish remained in troughs or stream sections with large rubble substrate than in troughs or sections with gravel substrate. Trout and salmon in many Idaho streams enter the substrate when stream temperatures declined to 4–6 C. A suitable substrate providing adequate interstices appears necessary or the fish leave.},

abstract = {—We quantified the relationship between lake size and abundance of walleyes Stizo-stedion vitreum at two life stages, age 0 and adult, in 172 northern Wisconsin lakes. We also determined if the relationship varied with recruitment source (stocked or natural) in order to evaluate the current system of management. For adult walleyes, as estimated by mark–recapture in spring, abundance was linearly related to lake surface area. Age-0 walleye abundance estimated by fall electrofishing catch was also linearly related to the miles of shoreline surveyed. Lake surface area explained 59% of the variability in adult walleye abundance across lakes ranging in size from 93 to 15,300 acres. Lake surface area explained 61% of the variation in abundance of self-sustaining walleye populations and 65% of stocked populations. Walleye abundance was higher in lakes sustained by natural reproduction than in lakes sustained by stocking. These patterns in abundance based on recruitment source were also apparent at age 0. We conclude that differences in abundance between self-sustaining and stocked walleye populations in northern Wisconsin lakes may be established during the first year, possibly due in part to recruitment source.},

abstract = {M. 2005. Modelling occurrence and abundance of species when detection is imperfect. {\'{A}}/ Oikos 110: 353 {\'{A}}/359. Relationships between species abundance and occupancy are of considerable interest in metapopulation biology and in macroecology. Such relationships may be described concisely using probability models that characterize variation in abundance of a species. However, estimation of the parameters of these models in most ecological problems is impaired by imperfect detection. When organisms are detected imperfectly, observed counts are biased estimates of true abundance, and this induces bias in stated occupancy or occurrence probability. In this paper we consider a class of models that enable estimation of abundance/occupancy relationships from counts of organisms that result from surveys in which detection is imperfect. Under such models, parameter estimation and inference are based on conventional likelihood methods. We provide an application of these models to geographically extensive breeding bird survey data in which alternative models of abundance are considered that include factors that influence variation in abundance and detectability. Using these models, we produce estimates of abundance and occupancy maps that honor important sources of spatial variation in avian abundance and provide clearly interpretable characterizations of abundance and occupancy adjusted for imperfect detection. With the introduction of the metapopulation concept (Levins 1969, Hanski 1999), considerable theoretical and practical attention has been focused on patch occupancy and related metapopulation concepts. Patch occupancy has replaced abundance as the state variable of interest in many animal population studies. At least in part, this is because many interesting ecological phenomena are naturally expressed in terms of occupancy metrics or related quantities (e.g. species range) but also because occurrence is simpler to quantify in many problems. Interest in patch occupancy, at least in a population monitoring context, is often motivated by its likely relationship to abundance. That is, site occupancy is believed to be an informative index to population status. A recent paper by He and Gaston (2003) focused on general phenomenological models for both the relation-ship between occupancy and abundance (Wright 1991, Hanski et al. 1993) and the relationship between the mean and variance of abundance over space (Taylor 1961). They combined the two general models into a single model and stated: ''the unification of the two general ecological patterns of variance/mean and occu-pancy/abundance implied by the model is novel and has not apparently been reported and investigated before'' (He and Gaston 2003: 366). Then, using several data sets, they estimate one of these two general relationships and used the resulting parameters to predict the other relationship in order to provide evidence that these two relationships ''are just different expressions of the same phenomenon'' (He and Gaston 2003: 367). In the present paper, we offer two suggestions for modeling and investigating the relationships discussed},

abstract = {1. It has been suggested that the habitats which a species occupies can be divided into sources and sinks, depending on whether or not local reproduction is sufficient to balance mortality. Source populations are those where reproduction exceeds mortality, surplus individuals dispersing to sink populations where mortality exceeds local reproduction. Sink populations would not be viable in the absence of immigration. 2. A difference equation model is constructed to show that sources and sinks cannot be identified from a simple comparison of the demographic rates between populations, as measured by the numbers of births and deaths. 3. Viable populations may appear to be non-viable simply because the dispersal of individuals into them depresses fecundity or increases mortality as a result of density-dependence. The consequence is that local recuitment appears insufficient to balance local mortality. 4. Viable populations that appear as sinks, as a result of the dispersal of individuals into them, are termed here as 'pseudo-sinks'. They will clearly be difficult to distinguish from genuine sinks on the basis of a simple comparison of the numbers of births and deaths in different populations. 5. Examples of source and genuine sink populations and the data required to establish them are discussed.},

abstract = {Diluted bitumen (dilbit; the product of oil sands extraction) is transported through freshwater ecosystems critical to Pacific salmon. This is concerning, because crude oil disrupts cardiac development, morphology, and function in embryonic fish, and cardiac impairment in salmon can have major consequences on migratory success and fitness. The sensitivity of early life-stage salmon to dilbit and its specific cardiotoxic effects are unknown. Sockeye salmon parr were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of dilbit for 1 wk and 4 wk, followed by an examination of molecular, morphological, and organismal endpoints related to cardiotoxicity. We show that parr are sensitive to WSF of dilbit, with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations of 3.5 µg/L sufficient to induce a liver biomarker of PAH exposure, and total PAH of 16.4 µg/L and 66.7 µg/L inducing PAH biomarkers in the heart. Furthermore, WSF of dilbit induces concentration–dependent cardiac remodeling coincident with performance effects: fish exposed to 66.7 µg/L total PAH have relatively fewer myocytes and more collagen in the compact myocardium and impaired swimming performance at 4 wk, whereas the opposite changes occur in fish exposed to 3.5 µg/L total PAH. The results demonstrate cardiac sensitivity to dilbit exposure that could directly impact sockeye migratory success. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;9999:1–7. {\textcopyright} 2016 SETAC},

Through a multidisciplinary and systemic approach, combining analyses of fisheries and market data with interviews with key stakeholders, we analyze adaptive responses of the main system components in France and Spain, considering how the fishing sector and fishery management institutions have adapted to changes. Focusing on the question “what has been lost and gained following the collapse?”, we find that while the anchovy stock has recovered, the fishery system has not returned to its pre-collapse status with important socio-economic features having been lost. We highlight the need for holistic consideration of multiple system components and diverse stakeholders' perspectives. The perceived losses and gains from the anchovy fishery collapse and aftermath are found to vary across the players in the fishery system, depending as well on the management objectives and scales being considered. Such retrospective analysis can serve as a basis for understanding the long-term responses to social-ecological changes in fisheries and identifying the role of governance mechanisms in supporting adaptations that maintain sustainable fishery systems in the face of future potential shocks.},

abstract = {An abstract model of a pursuit-evasion game using tools from network economics is presented. Animal moves are represented as human migrations: people move to destinations that they find agreeable to migrate to and the associated decision-making depends on the specific characteristics of the location that they come from, the place that they migrate to, the distance between both, but also on the density and the characteristics of the other members of the human population living there. This competitive behavior results in a simple non-cooperative game. The repetition of this game, in turn, yields a dynamical system, the equilibrium of which may be computed using variational inequality tools. These ideas are implemented in the model of a vertical marine ecosystem in which big fish pursue small fish that try to evade, with the small fish preferring to live in surface and with the big fish preferring to reside in depth. The theoretical and computational results suggest that the specific trade-offs for both pursuers and evaders are important for the stability and the permanence of ecosystems. Then, we discuss how this quite simple model could be a first step toward a game theoretical formalization of the connectivity of marine ecosystems, which is an important and open question in marine ecology. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.},

A number of patterns and processes have been identified that suggest understanding the risk of collapse requires knowledge of the fishing effort response, degree of depensation in the fishery and the life history of the harvested species. Processes involving the behaviour of fish, behaviour of anglers and management responses to declining quality can all impact the degree of resilience of recreational fisheries and their risk of collapse. The spatial context of an individual fishery can be important as they are often embedded in lake districts and joined by mobile anglers so their local dynamics are not independent from other fisheries. Typical regulations that restrict the behaviour of individual anglers in open-access fisheries can provide some resilience but cannot prevent collapse if the fishing effort is too high. Many uncertainties remain related to the occurrence and intensity of the key processes and therefore adopting an adaptive experime},

The approaches were grouped by their central focus: habitat, individual, population, and community– ecosystem. A set of case studies is used to illustrate the use of some approaches drawn from freshwater and marine contexts. Ten components to assessing no net loss of PC were developed and used in the review of approaches for evaluating poten- tial limitations. The review also highlighted the likely future direction of method development, with increasing emphasis on dynamic models integrating population responses to habitat supply characteristics. More work needs to be done to turn re- search-based metrics of PC into practical operational management assessment tools and to better quantify the link between habitat structure and function and fisheries productivity. The evolving approaches to measure PC reinforce the ties that fish habitat management has to the emerging practices in ecosystem-based management.},

abstract = {Researchers have long recognized the importance of ecological differences at the species level in structuring natural communities yet until recently have often overlooked the influence of intraspecific trait variation, which can profoundly alter community dynamics [1]. Human extraction of living resources can reduce intraspecific trait variation by, for example, causing truncation of age and size structure of populations, where numbers of older individuals decline far more with exploitation than younger individuals. Age truncation can negatively affect population and community stability, increasing variability in population and community biomass [2–6], reducing productivity [7–10] and life-history diversity in traits such as the spatial and temporal pattern of reproduction and migration [4, 11–16]. Here, we quantified the extent of age truncation in 63 fished populations across five ocean regions, as measured by how much the proportions of fish in the oldest age groups declined over time. The proportion of individuals in the oldest age classes decreased significantly in 79% to 97% of populations (compared to historical or unfished values, respectively), and the magnitude of decline was greater than 90% in 32% to 41% of populations. The pervasiveness and intensity of age truncation indicates that fishing is likely reducing the stability of many marine communities. Our findings suggest that more emphasis should be given to management measures that reduce the impact of fishing on age truncation, including no-take areas, slot limits that prohibit fishing on all except a narrow range of fish sizes, and rotational harvesting. Barnett et al. show that age truncation is prevalent and often severe in exploited marine fish populations. These changes in age structure likely reduce trait diversity and thus may reduce stability of fish populations and marine communities.},

abstract = {Following an extreme drawdown of Lake Tohopekaliga, Florida, USA, in 1987 during which excessive organic substrate was removed, the lake was sampled for littoral invertebrates by dip net and corer in 1988-89. The numbers of invertebrates (densities and taxa) associated with macrophytes in restored areas were less than they were in undisturbed (control) areas in 1988. One year later (1989), the densities of these invertebrates were greater in restored areas, but the number of taxonomic megagroups (families, orders or classes) were still higher in control areas. The densities and taxonomic diversities of bottom-dwelling (corer samples) invertebrates were consistently greater in the restored areas. Chironomidae and Oligochaeta comprised >29% of the total invertebrate population. Important groups also included Palaemonidae, Coenagrionideae, Baetidae, Caenidae, Hyalellidae and Hydrophilidae. The observed changes and differences in the invertebrate communities were generally attributed to changes and differences in macrophyte densities, ratios of submerged-floating to emergent plants, concentration of dead vegetation, ratios of air-breathing to gill-breathing invertebrates and fish predation. Fish predation was probably the single most important factor in shaping the restored invertebrate community},

Using a simulation model, we explored how scenarios of population-specific migration and uncertainty in aspects of bluefin tuna biology affect the magnitude, distribution, and mixed stock nature of the resource and catch of its associated fisheries. The analytical framework was a stochastic, age-structured, stock-overlap model that was seasonally and spatially explicit with movement of eastern- and western-origin tuna informed by tagging and otolith chemistry data. Alternate estimates of movement and assumptions regarding maturity and recruitment regime for westernorigin fish were considered. Simulation of the operating model indicated considerable stock mixing in the western and central Atlantic, which resulted in differences between the stock and population view of western bluefin tuna. The relative biomass of the western population and its spatial and temporal distribution in the Atlantic was sensitive to model assumptions and configurations. Simulation modeling can provide a means to ascertain the potential consequences of stock mixing on the assessment and management of fishery resources.},

abstract = {We use an individual-based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an "evolutionary rescue" in a fragmented landscape. Kin competition has a quantitative effect on the evolution of migration rate in our model, but these patterns in the evolution of migration rate appear to be primarily caused by spatiotemporal variation in fitness and mortality during migration. We apply the model to real habitat patch networks occupied by two checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea) species, for which sufficient data are available to estimate rigorously most of the model parameters. The model-predicted migration rate is not significantly different from the empirically observed one. Regional variation in patch areas and connectivities leads to regional variation in the optimal migration rate, predictions that can be tested empirically.},

abstract = {1 The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2 Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3 Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4 At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5 Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed. [References: 47] English Article},

abstract = {Despite broad recognition of the potential for significant spatial complexity in morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (. Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations.},

Salinity levels at biological monitoring stations ranged from 0.12--31.3‰. Lotic regions with salinities greater than 10‰ were dominated by larvae of the dipterans Ephydra and Culicoides . In regions with salinities less than 10‰ species richness increased more or less linearly with decreasing levels of chloride salts. Ephemeropterans appeared to be one of the major invertebrate groups least tolerant of elevated NaCl levels and were absent in regions with salinities greater than 2‰ Availability of food resources, such as periphyton and particulate organic matter, did not appear to be grossly altered in disturbed regions, and it is suggested that the observed distribution of macroinvertebrate fauna was largely in response to taxonomic differences in salt tolerance. Fish seemed to be more tolerant of highly saline conditions, and several species were observed in regions experiencing salinities as high as 15‰. Accordingly, assemblages of fish taxa along the salinity gradient may have been influenced by trophic factors, such as spatial limitations in availability of invertebrate prey.},

abstract = {1. Many far-ranging bird and mammal species aggregate in colonies to breed, and most individuals remain faithful to one colony. Here, we use modelling to explore the con- sequences of this site fidelity for the metapopulation dynamics of such species. 2. We develop a spatially explicit model of the annual transfer process between colonies. We apply it to different spatial arrangements of 20 identical colonies and thus demonstrate that connectivity alone can, in the short term, give rise to heterogeneity in colony size. 3. We place the annual transfer model within a state-structured population model and examine the consequences of local and global density dependence for long-term dynamics. For each scenario, we investigate the implications of the strength of site fidelity, the cost of migration and the population's intrinsic growth rate. 4. Our results suggest that, under local density dependence, site fidelity slows down the colonization process and can temporarily trap the entire population in a subset of the available potential colonies. When site fidelity is strong, the metapopulation follows a step-like trajectory. Population growth occurs only rarely because individuals must overcome their site-fidelity to found new colonies. Even though this effect is temporary, it renders the entire metapopulation vulnerable to rare catastrophic collapses. 5. Under global density dependence, site fidelity imposes competition between colonies for the limiting resource. Stochastic events lead to the dominance of certain colonies and the temporary extinction of others. If site fidelity is strong, it can permanently prevent the metapopulation from occupying all available potential colonies. 6. We conclude that, irrespective of the mechanism of population regulation, colonially breeding species that show strong site fidelity are likely to occupy only a portion of the breeding habitat available to them.

abstract = {We used regression quantiles to model potentially limiting relationships between the standing crop of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki and measures of stream channel morphology. Regression quantile models indicated that variation in fish density was inversely related to the width:depth ratio of streams but not to stream width or depth alone. The spatial and temporal stability of model predictions were examined across years and streams, respectively. Variation in fish density with width:depth ratio (10th-90th regression quantiles) modeled for streams sampled in 1993-1997 predicted the variation observed in 1998-1999, indicating similar habitat relationships across years. Both linear and nonlinear models described the limiting relationships well, the latter performing slightly better. Although estimated relationships were transferable in time, results were strongly dependent on the influence of spatial variation in fish density among streams. Density changes with width:depth ratio in a single stream were responsible for the significant (P < 0.10) negative slopes estimated for the higher quantiles (>80th). This Suggests that stream-scale factors other than width:depth ratio play a more direct role in determining population density. Much of the variation in densities of cutthroat trout among streams was attributed to the occurrence of nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis (a possible competitor) or connectivity to migratory habitats. Regression quantiles can be useful for estimating the effects of limiting factors when ecological responses are highly variable, but our results indicate that spatiotemporal variability in the data should be explicitly considered. In this study, data from individual streams and stream-specific characteristics (e.g., the occurrence of nonnative species and habitat connectivity) strongly affected our interpretation of the relationship between width:depth ratio and fish density.},

abstract = {Summary 1.?The use of marine reserves as tools either for conservation or fisheries management requires rigorous empirical evidence for the recovery of exploited species within them. 2.?The relative density and size structure of snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae), an intensively exploited reef fish species, were measured, using baited underwater video, inside and outside three northern New Zealand marine reserves (Leigh Marine Reserve, Hahei Marine Reserve and Tawharanui Marine Park) every 6 months from October 1997 to April 1999. 3.?Log-linear modelling showed that relative total density and egg production of snapper were higher in all three reserves than in fished areas. Snapper that were larger than the minimum legal size were estimated to be 14 times denser in protected areas than in fished areas, and the relative egg production was estimated to be 18 times higher. In the Leigh reserve, legal-size snapper were larger than legal-size snapper in fished areas. 4.?At the Leigh reserve, snapper density consistently peaked at the reserve centre and declined towards either boundary, which suggests that snapper became increasingly vulnerable to fishing towards the reserve boundaries. 5.?Inshore snapper density was significantly higher in autumn than in spring, supporting previous suggestions that snapper make regular onshore?offshore seasonal migrations that might be related to spawning. We suggest that the observed recovery of snapper populations within reserves is attributable to immigration of individuals from fished areas that take up residency within reserves, rather than juvenile recruitment. 6.?Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting an exploited species previously thought to be too mobile to respond to area-based protection. Although it is difficult to envisage significant enhancement of fished areas via adult emigration, it is likely that the reserves contribute significantly to local gamete production. In addition, the protection of fish populations within reserves might slow reductions in genetic diversity caused by size-selective mortality brought about by exploitation.},

abstract = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

abstract = {Many small, isolated north temperate waterbodies experience hypoxic conditions and winterkill events. Although such waterbodies are found in the natural ranges of two congeneric sunfishes (pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus and bluegill, L. macrochirus), many contain pumpkinseed but no bluegill; a biogeographic pattern that has remained unexplained. To test whether a greater hypoxia tolerance in pumpkinseeds could explain these differences in distribution, we conducted hypoxia tolerance trials by subjecting each species to declining oxygen concentrations over ca. 16 h in aquaria. We also measured the activities of key metabolic enzymes in the muscle of wild individuals. Pumpkinseeds showed significantly higher tolerance to hypoxic stress than bluegills, as indicated by dissolved oxygen concentration at the time of equilibrium loss. Consistent with this result, white muscle from pumpkinseed had higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker enzyme for anaerobic capacity. There was no difference between species in the activity level of pyruvate kinase, suggesting that pumpkinseed do not display a general upregulation of glycolysis, but rather an upregulation of anaerobic capacity. Our results support the hypothesis that evolved differences in winter hypoxia tolerance can act as a macrohabitat partitioning mechanism in North American sunfishes.},

abstract = {The pattern of temporal change in recruitment of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) entering the ocean between 1963 and 1990 was geographically coherent in all regions of British Columbia. A major increase in recruitment was evident for smolts entering the ocean after 1977. Subsequently, an out-of-phase response occurred after 1990, indicating that the effect of a possible 1990 regime shift had both temporal and geographical structure. Steelhead entering northern regions had increasing recruitment, while steelhead entering southern BC coastal regions had sharply decreasing recruitment. The evidence clearly indicates that the overall recruitment response since 1977 was primarily shaped by changes in marine (not freshwater) survival. Similar sudden changes in adult recruitment also appear to be occurring for other species of Pacific salmon in BC and Oregon, such as coho (O. kisutch), which appear to occur suddenly and show considerable persistence. A possible explanation for the change is that ocean productivity declined in coastal regions of southern BC after 1990, reducing the marine growth of juvenile salmon. The Bakun upwelling index shows a pattern of geographical coherence along the west coast of North America that could in principle explain the observed pattern of changes in recruitment. However, no evidence for a temporal shift in this index occurring around 1977 and 1990 is apparent. The reason for the sudden and persistent decline in ocean survival is therefore uncertain.},

abstract = {Aim: Understanding the biodiversity–stability relationship has become a central issue in ecology and conservation biology. Although the stabilizing effects of tree species diversity on ecosystem productivity are well recorded in small local communities, they remain poorly understood across scales (from local to larger spatial scales). This study evaluates biodiversity–stability effects from local to larger spatial scales in a large temperate forest region, considering a range of environmental conditions and environmental heterogeneity. Location: North-eastern China (c. 700,000 km2). Time period: 2005–2017. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: We define stability as the temporal invariability of biomass productivity. Regional metacommunities representing larger spatial scales were developed by aggregating multiple sets of local field plots. Simple regression analysis was used to test biodiversity–stability relationships in metacommunities. Piecewise structural equation modelling was then used to disentangle the effects of diversity and abiotic variables on forest stability at local and larger spatial scales. Multiple mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the relative contribution of individual predictive variables to stability across spatial scales. Results: We found that local diversity (alpha diversity) was positively related to the stability of local communities (alpha stability), whereas species turnover across space (beta diversity) was positively related to asynchronous dynamics among local communities (spatial asynchrony), regardless of whether abiotic factors were considered or not. We also found that environmental conditions and environmental heterogeneity affected forest stability across scales. The effect of spatial asynchrony on gamma stability was greater than that of alpha stability. Main conclusions: Our results imply that spatial asynchrony is a key to maintaining the stability of ecosystem productivity within a large temperate forest region. We suggest that diverse forests and heterogeneous landscapes should be sustained at multiple spatial scales to buffer the negative effects of climate change and forest degradation.},

abstract = {Species, habitats, and ecosystems are increasingly exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors, fueling a rapidly expanding research program to understand the cumulative impacts of these environmental modifications. Since the 1970s, a growing set of methods has been developed through two parallel, sometimes connected, streams of research within the applied and academic realms to assess cumulative effects. Past reviews of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) methods focused on approaches used by practitioners. Academic research has developed several distinct and novel approaches to conducting CEA. Understanding the suite of methods that exist will help practitioners and academics better address various ecological foci (physiological responses, population impacts, ecosystem impacts) and ecological complexities (synergistic effects, impacts across space and time). We reviewed 6 categories of methods (experimental, meta-analysis, single-species modeling, mapping, qualitative modeling, and multispecies modeling) and examined the ability of those methods to address different levels of complexity. We focused on research gaps and emerging priorities. We found that no single method assessed impacts across the 4 ecological foci and 6 ecological complexities considered. We propose that methods can be used in combination to improve understanding such that multimodel inference can provide a suite of comparable outputs, mapping methods can help prioritize localized models or experimental gaps, and future experiments can be paired from the outset with models they will inform.},

From 1971 to 1978 I conducted an exploitation experiment on lake whitefish (Coaegonres ciupeaJormis) in four Northwest Territories lakes. The objective was to test the hypotheses that, when exploited, growth and recruitment would increase in the populations, and that the degree of increase would be proportioilal tc$\sim$ the intensity of exploitation. Significant increases in size-at-age were recorded in the exploited lakes, and the degree and persistence of the increase were proportional to the intensity of exploitation. Gooc% recruitment was stimulated in the heavily exploited lake, and to a lesser degree in the moderately exploited lake. The hypotheses were, therefore, corroborated. Analyses of growth and year-class strength in the unexploited control lake and the lightly exploited lake indicated that natural variation in growth and recruitnsent, on a similar scale to that stimulated by exploitation, had occurred in the past. The cornpen-satory responses of lake whitefish populations to exploitation appear to be a logical contpequence of the natural population regulating mechanisms for the species. The results of my experiment indicate that in unexploited lakes, recruitment and growth of young fish is regulated by the established populatioia of mature fish.

We evaluated the potential for recruitment compensation in largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides by stocking six 0.4-ha hatchery ponds with adult densities ranging from 6 to 40 fish over 2 years. Ponds were drained in October each year, and the age-0 fish densities were used as a measure of recruitment. We found no relationship between stock abundance and recruitment; ponds with low adult densities produced nearly as many recruits as the higher-density ponds in some cases. Both prey abundance and the growth of age-0 largemouth bass declined with age-0 fish density. Recruit abundance was highly variable both within and among the adult density groups, and thus we were unable to identify a clear stock-recruit relationship for largemouth bass. Our results indicate that reducing the number of effective spawners via angling practices would not reduce recruitment over a relatively large range in stock size.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {There are many examples of ecological theory informing fishery management. Yet fisheries also provide tremendous opportunities to test ecological theory through large-scale, repeated, and well-documented perturbations of natural systems. Although treating fisheries as experiments presents several challenges, few comparable tests exist at the ecosystem scale. Experimental manipulations of fish populations in lakes have been widely used to develop and test ecological theory. Controlled manipulation of fish populations in open marine systems is rarely possible, but fisheries data provide a valuable substitute for such manipulations. To highlight the value of marine fisheries data, we review leading ecological theories that have been empirically tested using such data. For example, density dependence has been examined through meta-analysis of spawning stock and recruitment data to show that compensation (higher population growth) occurs commonly when populations are reduced to low levels, while depensation (the Allee effect) is rare. As populations decline, spatial changes typically involve populations contracting into highdensity core habitats while abandoning less productive habitats. Fishing down predators may result in trophic cascades, possibly shifting entire ecosystems into alternate stable states, although alternate states can be maintained by both ecological processes and continued fishing pressure. Conversely, depleting low trophic level groups may affect central-place foragers, although these bottom–up effects rarely appear to impact fish—perhaps because many fish populations have been reduced to the point that they are no longer prey limited. Fisheries provide empirical tests for diversity–stability relations: catch data suggest that more diverse systems recover faster and provide more stable returns than less diverse systems. Fisheries have also provided examples of the tragedy of the commons, as well as counter-examples where common property resources have been managed successfully. We also address two barriers to use of fisheries data to answer ecological questions: differences in terminology for similar concepts and misuse of records of fishery landings (catch data) as a proxy for biomass trends.},

abstract = {For fisheries with multiple, competing objectives, identifying and applying reference points for management can present difficult trade-offs between long-term biological and shorter-term socioeconomic considerations. The term biological benchmarks is proposed to demarcate zones of population status based on conservation and production considerations. These scientifically derived benchmarks contrast with management reference points that generally require additional shorter-term socioeconomic information best obtained through public consultations. This paper illustrates the distinction between biological benchmarks and management reference points with a case study on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). In Canada, the management and assessment of wild Pacific salmon are guided by a major 2005 conservation policy, which calls for the identification of biological benchmarks to categorize status of demographically isolated populations, and decision-support tools, such as management reference points, to integrate biological information with appropriate social and economic information. In the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), the selection of management reference points for sockeye salmon (O. nerka) fisheries explicitly considered trade-offs between the probability of meeting long-term biological objectives on component populations and harvest objectives on population aggregates. Decisions about reference points were made in a consultative process that included extensive stakeholder engagement. Other agencies are urged to distinguish biological benchmarks from management reference points to ensure transparency in the relative influence of biological versus socioeconomic information in decision making.

abstract = {Hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (Lf) Royle] is one of the most serious invasive aquatic weed problems in the USA. This plant possesses numerous mechanisms of vegetative reproduction that enable it to spread very rapidly. Management of this weed has been achieved by the systemic treatment of water bodies with the herbicide fluridone. At least three dioecious fluridone-resistant biotypes of hydrilla with two- to fivefold higher resistance to the herbicide than the wild-type have been identified. Resistance is the result of one of three independent somatic mutations at the arginine 304 codon of the gene encoding phytoene desaturase, the molecular target site of fluridone. The specific activities of the three purified phytoene desaturase variants are similar to the wild-type enzyme. The appearance of these herbicide-resistant biotypes may jeopardize the ability to control the spread of this non-indigenous species to other water bodies in the southern USA. The objective of this paper is to provide general information about the biology and physiology of this aquatic weed in relation to its recent development of resistance to the herbicide fluridone, and to discuss how this discovery might lead to a new generation of herbicide-resistant crops.},

Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-$\alpha$, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r2 = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r2 = 0.39–0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.},

abstract = {Abstract

Twenty-first century conservation is centered on negotiating trade-offs between the diverse needs of people and the needs of the other species constituting coupled human-natural ecosystems. Marine forage fishes, such as sardines, anchovies and herring, are a nexus for such trade-offs because they are both central nodes in marine food webs and targeted by fisheries. An important example is Pacific herring,
Clupea pallisii
in the Northeast Pacific. Herring populations are subject to two distinct fisheries: one that harvests adults and one that harvests spawned eggs. We develop stochastic, age-structured models to assess the interaction between fisheries, herring populations and the persistence of predators reliant on herring populations. We show that egg- and adult-fishing have asymmetric effects on herring population dynamics - herring stocks can withstand higher levels of egg harvest before becoming depleted. Second, ecosystem thresholds proposed to ensure the persistence of herring predators do not necessarily pose more stringent constraints on fisheries than conventional, fishery driven harvest guidelines. Our approach provides a general template to evaluate ecosystem trade-offs between stage-specific harvest practices in relation to environmental variability, the risk of fishery closures and the risk of exceeding ecosystem thresholds intended to ensure conservation goals are met.},

abstract = {Many of the world's fisheries are unassessed, with little information about population status or risk of overfishing. Unassessed fisheries are particularly predominant in developing countries and in small-scale fisheries, where they are important for food security. Several catch-only methods based on time series of fishery catch and commonly available life-history traits have been developed to estimate stock status (defined as biomass relative to biomass at maximum sustainable yield: B/BMSY). While their stock status performance has been extensively studied, performance of catch-only models as a management tool is unknown. We evaluated the extent to which a superensemble of three prominent catch-only models can provide a reliable basis for fisheries management and how performance compares across management strategies that control catch or fishing effort. We used a management strategy evaluation framework to determine whether a superensemble of catch-only models can reliably inform harvest control rules (HCRs). Across five simulated fish life histories and two harvest-dynamic types, catch-only models and HCR combinations reduced the risk of overfishing and increased the proportion of stocks above BMSY compared to business as usual, though often resulted in poor yields. Precautionary HCRs based on fishing effort were robust and insensitive to error in catch-only models, while catch-based HCRs caused high probabilities of overfishing and more overfished populations. Catch-only methods tended to overestimate B/BMSY for our simulated data sets. The catch-only superensemble combined with precautionary effort-based HCRs could be part of a stepping stone approach for managing some data-limited stocks while working towards more data-moderate assessment methods.},

abstract = {For many fish taxa, trophic position and relative fecundity increase with body size, yet fisheries remove the largest individuals, altering food webs and reducing population productivity. Marine reserves and other forms of spatial protection can help mitigate this problem, but the effectiveness of these management tools may vary interspecifically and spatially. Using visual survey data collected on the Central Coast of British Columbia, for 12 species of exploited rockfish we found that body size responses to spatial fishery closures depended on interspecific variation in growth parameter k (the rate at which the asymptotic body size is approached) and on location. For two closures, relative body sizes were larger at protected than at adjacent fished sites, and these differences were greater for species with lower k values. Reduced fishery mortality likely drove these results, as an unfished species did not respond to spatial protection. For three closures, however, body sizes did not differ between protected and adjacent fished sites, and for another closure species with higher k values were larger at fished than at protected sites while species with lower k values had similar sizes in both treatments. Variation in the age of closures is unlikely to have influenced results, as most data were collected when closures were 13 to 15-years-old. Rather, the lack of larger fish inside four of six spatial fishery closures potentially reflects a combination of smaller size of the area protected, poor fisher compliance, and lower oceanographic productivity. Interspecific differences in movement behavior did not affect body size responses to spatial protection. To improve understanding, additional research should be conducted at deeper depths encompassing the distribution of older, larger fish. Our study-which was conceptualized and executed by an alliance of Indigenous peoples seeking to restore rockfishes-illustrates how life history and behavioral theory provide a useful lens for framing and interpreting species differences in responses to spatial protection.},

abstract = {For nearly a century, biologists have emphasized the profound importance of spatial scale for ecology, evolution and conservation. Nonetheless, objectively identifying critical scales has proven incredibly challenging. Here we extend new techniques from physics and social sciences that estimate modularity on networks to identify critical scales for movement and gene flow in animals. Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale. We argue that network modularity reveals critical meso-scales that are probably common in populations, providing a powerful means of identifying fundamental scales for biology and for conservation strategies aimed at recovering imperilled species.},

abstract = {Fish biomass is the most widely used indicator of fish stock health. Stocks whose biomass is or has previously collapsed owing to overfishing, and the management systems built around them, may carry a memory of decline, even if biomass has recovered. This is because stock biomass as the main indicator of stock health does not represent all aspects of stock health and biomass can possibly become a weaker indicator of health after stock collapse. These latent weaknesses have been termed “ghosts of overfishing past”. Not accounting for ghosts can impact the speed of stock recovery and susceptibility to further collapses. This concept has been popularised by Professors Jeff Hutchings, Anna Kuparinen, and others. Ghosts are varied and can include changes in vital rates, phenotypic response, fish behaviour, and aspects of the human system such as institutional inertia, fisheries subsidies, and income portfolios. The presence of ghosts has implications for fisheries management: altering stock biomass objectives (dynamic reference points) may be appropriate for populations that have experienced collapse even if biomass has recovered. Ghosts should be considered when developing management strategies for populations that have previously experienced large declines.},

Its extensive use by individuals to locate food patches has been documented in a number of species, and various mechanisms of discovery have been identified. However, less is known about whether individuals differ in their access to, and use of, social information to find food. We measured the social network of a wild population of three sympatric tit species (family Paridae) and then recorded individual discovery of novel food patches. By using recently developed methods for network-based diffusion analysis, we show that order of arrival at new food patches was predicted by social associations. Models based only on group searching did not explain this relationship. Furthermore, network position was correlated with likelihood of patch discovery, with central individuals more likely to locate and use novel foraging patches than those with limited social connections. These results demonstrate the utility of social network analysis as a method to investigate social information use, and suggest that the greater probability of receiving social information about new foraging patches confers a benefit on more socially connected individuals.},

abstract = {Fisheries management regimes take many forms, but most fail to designate shares of the catch. This failure creates strong incentives for individuals to maximize their share without regard to long-term sustainability, because the benefits of conservation actions do not accrue to individuals. The competition to maximize catch usually entails excessive capital investments in fishing vessels and gear and intense fishing pressure, resulting in overfishing, high bycatch rates, and the use of large, efficient types of gear that can harm habitat. Managers respond by increasing regulations, but this often exacerbates perverse incentives. In addition, many fisheries could be producing more value than the current system permits, i.e. large quantities of fish are landed during short seasons, forcing fishermen to sell for low prices. Conservation and economic problems facing fisheries can be addressed in an integrated way, by designating access privileges (specifying shares of the catch) to individuals, harvest cooperatives, fishing sectors, communities, or other appropriate entities. Designated Access Privilege (DAP) systems demonstrably end the competition to maximize catch and often result in better conservation and financial performance. The cost of implementing these systems can be relatively high and has been a barrier to better management. However, this doesn't have to be so. Fisheries could accept investments from a variety of sources and use a portion of the increased financial performance to repay recoverable grants and loans. The key to protecting fish stocks, habitats, and the communities that depend on them will be to implement DAPs that are appropriate for each fishery or community, making investments in sustainability, and creating financing mechanisms that are themselves sustainable, drawing on the increased value that DAP fisheries can produce.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

abstract = {Modeling of body growth forms an essential part of many fisheries stock assessments. Growth influences population dynamics through its effects on lifetime patterns of biomass production, natural and fishing mortality, and reproductive output. By relating size to age, growth models also enable the use of size-based data in age-based stock assessments. Growth patterns are commonly assumed to be constant (time-invariant) or at best subject to inconsequential process noise. However, fish growth is inherently plastic, often responding strongly to environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability. In wild fish stocks, this results in median temporal variation of around 15% in length-at-age and 40% in weight-at-age, with extremes of 20% (length) and 60% (weight). Plasticity mediates environmental forcing and density-dependence in growth, both of which can have important implications for stock assessment and management. Failing to account for such effects can lead to substantial deviations (often more than 30%) in reconstructed stock dynamics, projections and reference points. The nature and magnitude of such deviations depends not only on the statistical adequacy of the growth model but on how growth information is used in the stock assessment process and on the management options being evaluated. In addition to having direct assessment and management consequences, plasticity provides a unified conceptual framework for interpreting various disparate and at times, confusing patterns of fish growth. Therefore, I conclude that the "constant growth" paradigm of fisheries stock assessments should be replaced with a paradigm that embraces growth plasticity and its consequences.},

Retrospective patterns are systematic changes in estimates of population size, or other assessment model-derived quantities, that occur as additional years of data are added to, or removed from, a stock assessment. These patterns are an insidious problem, and can lead to severe errors when providing management advice. Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn's $\rho$ (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn's $\rho$ tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn's $\rho$ differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn's $\rho$ is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn's $\rho$ which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

abstract = {Movement is important for ecological and evolutionary theory as well as connectivity conservation, which is increasingly critical for species responding to environmental change. Key ecological and evolutionary outcomes of movement, such as population growth and gene flow, require effective dispersal: movement that is followed by successful reproduction. However, the relative roles of movement and postmovement reproduction for effective dispersal and connectivity remain unclear. Here we isolate the contributions of movement and immigrant reproduction to effective dispersal and connectivity across the entire breeding range of an endangered raptor, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). To do so, we unite mark-resight data on movement and reproduction across 9 years and 27 breeding patches with an integrated model that decomposes effective dispersal into its hierarchical levels of movement, postmovement breeding attempt, and postmovement reproductive success. We found that immigrant reproduction limits effective dispersal more than movement for this endangered species, demonstrating that even highly mobile species may have limited effective connectivity due to reduced immigrant reproduction. We found different environmental limitations for the reproductive component of effective dispersal compared with movement, indicating that different conservation strategies may be needed when promoting effective dispersal rather than movement alone. We also demonstrate that considering immigrant reproduction, rather than movement alone, alters which patches are the most essential for connectivity, thereby changing conservation priorities. These results challenge the assumption that understanding movement alone is sufficient to infer connectivity and highlight that connectivity conservation may require not only fostering movement but also successful reproduction of immigrants.},

abstract = {Abstract: The distribution of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) with respect to water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and light intensity was surveyed in three small Canadian Shield lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario. Based on hydroacoustic and gillnet surveys, there was considerable variation among lakes in temperatures occupied by lake trout during the summer. During the day, lake trout were concentrated at 4-8°C in Lake 375, broadly distributed from 6 to 15°C in Lake 442, and concentrated in the epilimnion at 19°C in Lake 468. At night, lake trout in all lakes occupied epilimnetic waters at 19-20°C. Lake trout inhabited highly oxygenated water, with 75-90% of fish at >6 mg dissolved oxygen {\textperiodcentered}L-1 throughout the spring and summer in all three lakes. Light intensity did not affect lake trout distribution in Lake 468 but may have contributed to lake trout daytime descent into cool waters in Lakes 375 and 442. We suggest that previously assumed niche boundaries of lake trout do not adequately describe critical habitat for the species in small lakes, the same lakes that are likely most sensitive to erosion of such habitat.

abstract = {Worldwide depletion of fish stocks has led fisheries managers to become increasingly concerned about rebuilding and recovery planning. To succeed, factors affecting recovery dynamics need to be understood, including the role of fisheries-induced evolution. Here we investigate a stock's response to fishing followed by a harvest moratorium by analyzing an individual-based evolutionary model parameterized for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from its northern range, representative of long-lived, late-maturing species. The model allows evolution of life-history processes including maturation, reproduction, and growth. It also incorporates environmental variability, phenotypic plasticity, and density-dependent feedbacks. Fisheries-induced evolution affects recovery in several ways. The first decades of recovery were dominated by demographic and density-dependent processes. Biomass rebuilding was only lightly influenced by fisheries-induced evolution, whereas other stock characteristics such as maturation age, spawning stock biomass, and recruitment were substantially affected, recovering to new demographic equilibria below their preharvest levels. This is because genetic traits took thousands of years to evolve back to preharvest levels, indicating that natural selection driving recovery of these traits is weaker than fisheries-induced selection was. Our results strengthen the case for proactive management of fisheries-induced evolution, as the restoration of genetic traits altered by fishing is slow and may even be impractical. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1976), opened a new era of federal fishery management in the United States. It was enacted primarily to establish a system for conserving and managing fisheries in the new 200-mile (EEZ). The US assumed exclusive authority for managing all fisheries within the EEZ, except for highly migratory species such as tunas and billfishes. Within the framework of the Act, eight Regional Fishery Management Councils (Regional Councils) were created, which are responsible for preparing Fisheries Management Plans (FMPs) in federal waters under their jurisdiction. Each FMP must meet a series of National Standards (NSs) for conservation and management. The Act was reauthorized in 1996 with the passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA), which aimed at fine tuning the fishery regulatory apparatus that was established under the original Act. This "fine tuning" involved increased attention to biological concerns, and removal of ambiguities within it. The Act was reauthorized again in 2007, mainly to provide for more clear directives and regulations to end overfishing. After more than thirty years since the Act was passed into law, the debate among conservationists, commercial and recreational fishery representatives, and politicians on the effectiveness of the Act in achieving its purported goals it still continues. Is the Act delivering on its promises? Do NSs reflect the most important priorities for the US fishery resources, conservation and sustainable exploitation? Do the Regional Councils represent all parties that should be involved in the fisheries resources management? The aim of this paper is to provide a critical analysis to answer these questions. This paper begins with a review of the Act and its background, followed by discussion and analysis of the Act's benefits and flaws. Finally, suggestions for the implementation of its structure and future directions in fishery management strategies are made. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that the spatial distribution of many marine pelagic organisms can be described by a hierarchical patch structure. Here, we present evidence for a hierarchical spatial distribution of murres (Uria spp.) foraging on capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Barents Sea. We found three distinct levels of patchiness. At the largest level we found spatial structures with a characteristic scale of >300 km, and a spatial overlap between murre and capelin. Within the large-scale structures, we found medium-scale patches with a characteristic scale of 50 km, and an overlap between the patches of murre and capelin. Within the medium-scale patches we found small-scale patches with a characteristic scale of 3 km. At the smallest scale there was no overlap between patches of capelin and murre. Our results indicate that murres actively track the spatial distribution of capelin at several scales. We suggest that murres use a strategy where the search pattern reflects the hierarchical properties of the prey system. Under this hypothesis the predator searches for large-scale patches by using long travel distances and low turning frequency. Once within a large-scale patch, the predator starts searching for smaller scale patches by using shorter travel distances and higher turning frequencies. Such a search pattern will minimize the area to be searched by the predator and move the predator upward in the hierarchical prey system in a stepwise fashion},

We showcase strong and ongoing marine governance by the Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais people of British Columbia, Canada. In partnership with the Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais Stewardship Authority, we synthesized information about marine governance by the Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais people as collated in their Heritage Database, a compilation of interviews and recordings with knowledge holders, traditional stories, and historical documents, e.g., journals of explorers and anthropologists. We found that Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais marine governance underpinned sustainable resource use and has remained strong despite colonial efforts to undermine it. Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais marine governance flows from the underlying principles of their indigenous law that guide all actions in the traditional territory. The social institutions of the Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais people are the mechanism for implementing marine governance: Importantly, hereditary chiefs hold key responsibilities regarding management of the oceans, embedded in ownership of specific places, passed on through names and stories. Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais protocols exist for respecting their territories, those of other nations, and the plants and animals being harvested. There are natural and spiritual consequences for not accessing and sharing marine resources in a way that follows Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais underlying principles, including loss of access. Contemporary examples of marine governance include the work of Kitasoo/Xai&#8217;xais Stewardship Authority, the Food Fish Committee guided by hereditary chiefs and elders, and everyone's actions to defend their territory from external threats. Given global efforts to recognize indigenous rights, an opportunity exists to change ocean management to fully recognize indigenous marine governance and leadership.},

Here, we analyze a time series of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance and examine the hypothesis that spatial contraction can decrease compen- satory capacity. Over the last 20 years, steelhead in the Keogh River have declined by an order of magnitude because of a period of poor smolt-to-adult survival. Low abundance has been associated with more depressed production of out-migrating smolts than would be expected based on traditional models of compensatory dynamics. Patterns of juvenile density over time show changes in the spatial distribution of the population. We developed a spatially explicit population model to explore spatial structure and juvenile recruitment under varying marine survival. Results suggest that spatial contraction during a period of poor marine survival can strengthen density-dependent population regulation, reducing smolt production at the watershed scale. Our results highlight that spatial contraction can alter the fundamental density-dependent relationships that define population dynamics, recovery trajectories, and sustainable harvest levels of spatially structured populations},

We evaluated the planning, design and performance of the Riffle 1B reconstruction on the Merced River. This is typical of the nine individual riffle reconstructions completed to date, involving excavation of the existing channel bed (here, to 0.6 m) and back-filling with smaller gravels believed to be more suitable for salmon spawning. We reviewed project documents, interviewed agency staff, and conducted field surveys to document channel conditions in 1994 for comparison with the project as constructed in 1990. The project planning and design did not consider the site's geomorphic context nor processes of erosion and sediment transport under the current flow regime. As a consequence, spawning-sized gravel placed in the channel was scoured and transported through the site at a flow with a return period of 1.5 years. The need for spawning habitat enhancement in the Merced River is questionable, but if such projects are to be built, we recommend that the project planning and design consider the site's geomorphic context and acknowledge the need for and provide funds for project maintenance, and that the performance of completed projects be systematically monitored and evaluated.},

There are two approaches to estimating age composition from a large number of length observations and a limited number of age determinations: the forward and the inverse age-length keys. The forward key looks at the distribution of age within each length bin while the inverse key looks at the distribution of length at each age. The former is more precise but has stringent requirements for the way data are collected. The latter approach is more widely applicable. We review the theory of the two keys with particular attention to necessary assumptions and the restrictions on when the methods are applicable. We show it is possible to combine the two approaches into a combined forward-inverse age-length key. This approach can be used to estimate age composition in several years simultaneously. It takes advantage of the efficiency of the forward key in years when that is appropriate, applies the inverse key to years with no age data, and uses a blending of the two approaches for years with moderate amounts of age data.},

abstract = {Salmonids often display a series of ontogenetic shifts in habitat, and these may also be associated with changes in diet. For example, adfluvial populations rear in streams for several years and then migrate to lakes. The patterns of habitat use, trophic ecology, and movements of such populations are commonly studied during the riverine stages. The lacustrine period is typically less well known, but salmonids may play an important ecological role as lake piscivores. In Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington, cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki are a top native piscivore and may affect the dynamics of the fish and zooplankton upon which they prey. Our objective was to study the growth, diet, and size distribution of cutthroat trout in littoral and limnetic habitats of Lake Washington, with emphasis on consumption of two of the lake's dominant pelagic planktivores: juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka and longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys. Cutthroat trout entered the lake at approximately age 2. As they grew larger, the cutthroat trout became increasingly piscivorous and tended to occupy the limnetic zone after they reached about 250 mm fork length (FL). Specifically, percentages (by wet weight) of fish in the diet of cutthroat trout increased from 22.5% for cutthroat trout smaller than 200 mm FL to over 95% for cutthroat trout larger than 400 mm FL. Fish made up a higher percentage of cutthroat trout diets in fall and winter in both the limnetic and littoral zones, and a greater proportion of fish was consumed in the limnetic zone than in the littoral zone. Variation in diet was observed among years (1995?2000), apparently reflecting the relative abundance of longfin smelt. The role of cutthroat trout both as the object of recreational fisheries and as a predator on sockeye salmon (valued in commercial and recreational fisheries) complicates management of this large, urban lake.},

abstract = {The Fisheries Act (Act), a long-standing Act protecting fisheries in Canada, was changed in 2012 to redefine its central purpose to the management of fisheries in Canada. Along with this refocus were changes that appeared to reduce protections for habitat and all fish. After an outcry by scientists, Indigenous peoples, and environmental organizations, the Act was revised in 2019 to “restore lost protections” thought to have been lost in the 2012 changes. To a large degree most of the “lost protections” have been restored, while other portions of the 2012 Act have been maintained. Challenges remain under the amended Act in efficiently implementing development and conservation projects while achieving the newly clarified purpose of the Act—the conservation and protection of fish and fish habitat.},

The goal of the model was to obtain decadal mortality estimates of three different size classes of winter skates (Leucoraja ocellata) on the eastern Scotian Shelf. The three time series of length disaggregated stages (Figure 1; Juvenile1, Juvenile2, and adult) are largely non-informative to the model parameters: catchability, recruitment rate, and stage transition probability. Consequently, it was necessary to include highly informative priors for these parameters to obtain reasonable mortality estimates. We did not implement this model in R due to the model containing 28 hyper parameters and 105 random effects which would have resulted in excessively long run times.},

abstract = {Animals face trade-offs between predation risk and foraging success depending on their location in the landscape; for example, individuals that remain near a common shelter may be safe from predation but incur stronger competition for resources. Despite a long tradition of theoretical exploration of the relationships among foraging success, conspecific competition, predation risk, and population distribution in a heterogeneous environment, the scenario we describe here has not been explored theoretically. We construct a model of habitat use rules to predict the distribution of a local population (prey sharing a common shelter and foraging across surrounding habitats). Our model describes realized habitat quality as a ratio of density- and location-dependent mortality to density-dependent growth. We explore how the prey distribution around a shelter is expected to change as the parameters governing the strength of density dependence, landscape characteristics, and local abundance vary. Within the range of parameters where prey spend some time away from shelter but remain site-attached, the prey density decreases away from shelter. As the distance at which prey react to predators increases, the population range generally increases. At intermediate reaction distances, however, increases in the reaction distance lead to decreases in the maximum foraging distance because of increased evenness in the population distribution. As total abundance increases, the population range increases, average population density increases, and realized quality decreases. The magnitude of these changes differs in, for example, 'high-' and 'low-visibility' landscapes where prey can detect predators at different distances. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Two groups of 15 and 20 large-mouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides Lacepede) were implanted with 400-day radio tags in February 2000 and 2001 to determine changes in movement and behavior before and after hydrilla reduction. Fish were located approximately every 10 days beginning two weeks after tag insertion; beginning in May 2000 diel movement was assessed once a month, and on each sampling date the fish were located every 4 hours for 24 hours (six locations per sampling date). Only fish that were at large in the lake for at least 200 days and with at least 35 locations were used for analysis; 19 fish met these criteria. Locations were grouped into two treatment levels based on the amount of hydrilla present in the system, a pre-treatment period (May to August 2000) when hydrilla coverage in Spring Creek was 72%, and a post treatment period (June to October 2001) when coverage was 22%. Most largemouth bass re- mained in the treatment area and maintained similar home range sizes during both treatment periods. However, fish ex- hibited greater movement, inhabited greater depths, and switched from using hydrilla to large woody debris after hyd- rilla was reduced. Fish may have responded to better foraging conditions by changing feeding strategies from ambushing to searching, which should increase foraging success. Decreased water clarity and increased threadfin shad abundance may have precipitated the increased daytime movement we ob- served in this study. Our data demonstrated that while large- mouth bass do not leave an area when hydrilla is reduced with fluridone, their behavior does change. Lake managers involved in aquatic plant removal programs can exchange this information with anglers concerning the effects of hydril- la treatment and potential impacts to the fishery.},

abstract = {The von Bertalanffy (VB) growth model has been extensively used to describe fish growth. However, it may not be the best predictor of lifetime growth patterns for fish with complex life history (e.g., hermaphroditism). We sought to determine if growth models accounting for maturity and sex change were more appropriate than the VB model at capturing the growth and maturation patterns of Gag Mycteroperca microlepis, a protogynous hermaphrodite. To account for changes in growth at maturity, we used the Lester et al. (2004) growth model (bi-phasic Lester) and a modified Lester et al. (2004) model to account for an additional growth phase at sex change (tri-phasic Lester). We also compared management reference points from each model using a yield-per-recruit (YPR) framework. The tri-phasic Lester model described growth and reproductive schedules better than the bi-phasic Lester or VB models, indicating separate growth phases associated with maturation and sex change. Estimates of FMAX from the YPR analysis were lower when using the tri-phasic Lester model (0.21 year-1) compared to the VB model (0.33 year-1) when growth parameters were linked to natural mortality. Fishing mortality rates resulting in 35% of unfished total and male-specific spawning stock biomasses-per-recruit were similar for all models, but female-specific estimates were lower using the bi-phasic Lester model. Reference points from the VB model were generally lower compared to either Lester model using natural mortality rates that were not tied with the growth parameters. Our results support arguments that a single growth curve is insufficient to capture lifetime growth of fish. However, growth curves from the VB and tri-phasic Lester models were similar for all ages, especially less than age 12. This suggests the VB model can be used to describe mean length-at-age when information on reproductive status is not available, but may result in inappropriate management recommendations.},

Both predators spent most of their time in the vegetation. Largemouth bass searched for bluegills and ambushed minnows, whereas the relatively immobile northern pike ambushed all prey. Minnows were closer to predators and were captured more frequently than bluegills. Even when minnows dispersed, they moved continually and eventually wandered within striking distance of a predator. Bluegills dispersed in the cover with predators. Bass captured the few bluegills that strayed into the open and pike captured those that approached too closely in the cover. The ability of predators to capture prey while residing in habitats containing patches of dense cover may explain their residence in areas often considered to be poor ones for foraging.},

We explored a wide range of scenarios for ocean and freshwater conditions and the response of salmon productivity (adult recruits per spawner) to those conditions. Our results show that stock assessments based on historical relationships between salmon productivity and climate-driven oceanographic conditions will likely perform poorly when those relationships change, even when such changes are anticipated and incorporated into stock assessment models in a timely manner. Estimating the relative importance of climate-driven oceanographic influences as a driver of sockeye productivity will be difficult, especially if climatic changes occur rapidly and concurrently with other disturbances. Thus, better understanding of the mechanisms by which climatic changes and other drivers influence salmon productivity may be essential to avoid undesirable management outcomes. As well, an expansion of monitoring of juvenile salmon abundances on more salmon stocks is needed to help distinguish the effects of different drivers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Yet, the factors determining the resilience of species remain poorly understood, due to disagreements on its definition and the lack of large-scale analyses. Here, we investigate how the life history of 910 natural populations of animals and plants predicts their intrinsic ability to be resilient. We show that demographic resilience can be achieved through different combinations of compensation, resistance and recovery after a disturbance. We demonstrate that these resilience components are highly correlated with life history traits related to the species' pace of life and reproductive strategy. Species with longer generation times require longer recovery times post-disturbance, whilst those with greater reproductive capacity have greater resistance and compensation. Our findings highlight the key role of life history traits to understand species resilience, improving our ability to predict how natural populations cope with disturbance regimes.},

abstract = {Fish age and length at 50% maturity are used extensively in the management of exploited fish populations. These parameters are historically estimated using logistic regression models (e.g., frequentist inference) for individual yearclasses and often fail to converge or result in insignificant results when a small sample size is used. The sample-size problem motivated us to evaluate whether a hierarchical logistic regression model fit using frequentist inference or Bayesian inference, could improve our ability to fit these models. Our objective was to compare Bayesian and frequentist inference for estimating age and length at 50% maturity to determine whether the models produced similar values. To make this evaluation, we used a long-term data set of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens from southern Lake Michigan. Frequentist inference of the year-class-specific models resulted in significant results when sample size was sufficiently large, a result that occurred in 76% of the models. The hierarchical model produces estimates of age (or length) at 50% maturity for all year-classes using both frequentist and Bayesian inference. However, Bayesian inference of the hierarchical model resulted in more precise parameter estimates and provided the complete posterior distribution in one seamless and easy approach, and the computation time was 78% to 83% faster.We suggest that a hierarchical model fit using Bayesian inference of age (or length) at 50% maturity is an improvement over frequentist interference methods by providing more information about the population of interest, particularly when sample sizes are limited. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2013.},

We employ variance components models that assume that the log of the standardized slope at the origin is a normal random variable.

abstract = {Habitat selection, and its associated density and frequency-dependent evolution, has a profound influence on such vital phenomena as population regulation, species interactions, the assembly of ecological communities, and the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Different strategies of habitat selection, and their importance in ecology and evolution, can often be revealed simply by plots of density in adjacent habitats. For individual species, the strategies are closely intertwined with mechanisms of population regulation, and with the persistence of populations through time. For interacting species, strategies of habitat selection are not only responsible for species coexistence, but provide one of the most convenient mechanisms for measuring compe-tition, and the various community structures caused by competitive interactions. Other kinds of interactions, such as those between predators and prey, demonstrate that an understanding of the coevolution of habitat-selection strategies among strongly interacting species is essential to properly interpret their spatial and temporal dynamics. At the evolutionary scale, the frequency dependence associated with habitat selection may often allow popu-lations to diverge and diversify into separate species. Habitat selection thereby demonstrates how we can map microevolutionary strategies in behavior onto their pop-ulation and community consequences, and from there, onto macroevolutionary patterns of speciation and adap-tive radiation. We can anticipate that future studies of habitat selection will not only help us complete those maps, but that they will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas that shape evolutionary ecology.},

abstract = {Increased mortality from fishing is expected to favor faster life histories, re- alized through earlier maturation, increased reproductive investment, and reduced postmaturation growth. There is also direct and indirect selection on behavioral traits. Molecular genetic methods have so far contributed min- imally to understanding such fisheries-induced evolution (FIE), but a large body of literature studying evolution using phenotypic methods has sug- gested that FIE in life-history traits, in particular maturation traits, is com- monplace in exploited fish populations. Although no phenotypic study in the wild can individually provide conclusive evidence for FIE, the observed common pattern suggests a common explanation, strengthening the case for FIE. This interpretation is supported by theoretical and experimental stud- ies. Evidence for FIE of behavioral traits is limited from the wild, but strong from experimental studies. We suggest that such evolution is also common, but has so far been overlooked.},

abstract = {Canada's constitution grants indigenous people priority access to marine resources, yet indigenous, commercial and recreational fishers target the same species. Avoiding conflict between different users, therefore, requires evidence-based policies that manage fisheries for conservation while respecting indigenous rights. From 2006 to 2015, Canada's Conservative government demoted the role of science in resource management, stifling research by federal agencies like Fisheries and Oceans Canada. To address ensuing data gaps, during 2014-2015 the Heiltsuk, Kitasoo/Xai'Xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations conducted coordinated research on Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), a culturally-significant resource. These indigenous groups are experiencing declining catch rates of Dungeness crab and postulate that commercial and recreational fisheries are primary causes of local declines. Accordingly, they applied indigenous laws and declared spatial fishery closures for commercial and recreational fishers at 10 sites (closed) while allowing exploitation by all users to continue at 10 other sites (open). Sampling occurred repeatedly over time and analyses compared temporal trends in population characteristics between closed and open sites. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that fisheries decrease the abundance and size of exploited species, but spatial protection can reverse these effects. The body size and catch-per-unit effort of legal-sized males increased over time at closed sites but declined at open sites. Importantly, fishery status did not affect temporal changes in the relative abundance of unfished classes of crab-sublegal males and females-which is logically consistent with the hypothesis. Our study demonstrates that indigenous governance can create spatial closures for conservation and research when Canada's government fails to do so. Long-term solutions, however, require collaboration in research and management between federal and indigenous governments. Towards that end, Canada's newly elected Liberal government has begun to restore federal science and to address indigenous rights, thereby enhancing the possibility of such collaboration.},

abstract = {We studied the trophic interactions and spatial distributions of bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in a macrophyte bed in Lake Onalaska, a backwater lake in the upper Mississippi River. The diets of adult and age-0 bluegills were similar and changed seasonally probably in response to changes in life stages of macroinvertebrates (i.e. emergence of winged adults). Diets and diel patterns of abundance of bluegill suggest that age-0 and adults were feeding in the vegetated, littoral zone. Predation by age-0 largemouth bass appears to influence use of vegetated habitat by age-0 bluegills. In summer, when most age-0 bluegills were vulnerable to predation by age-0 largemouth bass, bluegill abundance was strongly correlated with vegetation biomass. In October and November, piscivory by age-0 largemouth bass was limited by gape. Consequently, the relationship between the abundance of age-0 bluegills and vegetation biomass was weakened because predation risk by age-0 largemouth bass was reduced.},

abstract = {We explore a "Go With the Older Fish" (GWOF) mechanism of learned migration behaviour for exploited fish populations, where recruits learn a viable migration path by randomly joining a school of older fish. We develop a non-age-structured biomass model of spatially independent spawning sites with local density dependence, based on Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). We compare a diffusion (DIFF) strategy, where recruits adopt spawning sites near their natal site without regard to older fish, with GWOF, where recruits adopt the same spawning sites, but in proportion to the abundance of adults using those sites. In both models, older individuals return to their previous spawning site. The GWOF model leads to higher spatial variance in biomass. As total mortality increases, the DIFF strategy results in an approximately proportional decrease in biomass among spawning sites, whereas the GWOF strategy results in abandonment of less productive sites and maintenance of high biomass at more productive sites. A DIFF strategy leads to dynamics comparable to non-spatially structured populations. While the aggregate response of the GWOF strategy is distorted, non-stationary and slow to equilibrate, with a production curve that is distinctly flattened and relatively unproductive. These results indicate that fishing will disproportionately affect populations with GWOF behaviour.},

abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

abstract = {Throughout the world, rivers are increasingly fragmented by artificial barriers, such as damming and road crossing. In Japanese mountain streams, most populations of white-spotted charr, a salmonid fish, are highly fragmented by numerous small dams. Most of these dams were constructed after 1970. In this study, we conducted a population viability analysis of fragmented white-spotted charr populations using a simple individual based model. The constructed model is age-structured and density dependent that incorporates both demographic and environmental stochasticity. The probability of population persistence decreased substantially between after 30 years and after 100 years, especially for populations having a small carrying capacity. Even though white-spotted charr occupies many fragmented habitats now, our results suggest small fragmented populations are not viable. A sensitivity analysis showed that adult survival, not juvenile survival and egg number, was the most important criterion for the prospects of population persistence. Installations of efficient fish ladders or dam removal are necessary as soon as possible to restore dammed-off populations. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Frid2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd Unbiased survey data are important for understanding the effects of fisheries and environmental change on fish communities. We applied predation risk and life history theories to examine how parallel laser beams, which provide a scale for estimating transect width and the sizes of fish and habitat features, might bias groundfish counts during visual surveys conducted with a towed video camera. The laser beams project forward as “dots” onto the benthos, and species differ in their propensity to chase them. We hypothesized that fish perceive the laser dots as potential food and the camera, which lags behind the dots while moving forward, as a generalized threat. Analyses accounted for species primary diet and tested the prediction that shorter-lived species are more likely to chase the laser dots than longer-lived species, but these differences should weaken in the perceived safety of larger groups. Consistent with our predictions, the probability that fish would chase the laser dots decreased with the maximum age of species and increased with group size, although these effects were independent of each other. Also, chase probabilities were ≈20 to 25 times greater for species known to include benthic mobile prey in their diet than for species that feed primarily on pelagic, sessile or low-mobility prey. Our results suggest that risk-foraging trade-offs are inherent to fish behaviors that might bias surveys counts. While further insight into species differences is still needed, we illustrate how group size- and species-specific chase probabilities can generate bias correction factors to improve surveys counts.},

@article{Thorson2014,
abstract = {Spatial, phenotypic and genetic diversity at relatively small scales can buffer species against large-scale processes such as climate change that tend to synchronize populations and increase temporal variability in overall abundance or production. This portfolio effect generally results in improved biological and economic outcomes for managed species. Previous evidence for the portfolio effect in salmonids has arisen from examinations of time series of adult abundance, but we lack evidence of spatial buffering of temporal variability in demographic rates such as survival of juveniles during their first year of life. We therefore use density-dependent population models with multiple random effects to represent synchronous (similar among populations) and asynchronous (different among populations) temporal variability as well as spatial variability in survival. These are fitted to 25 years of survey data for breeding adults and surviving juveniles from 15 demographically distinct populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within a single metapopulation in the Snake River in Idaho, USA. Model selection identifies the most support for the model that included both synchronous and asynchronous temporal variability, in addition to spatial variability. Asynchronous variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}55) is approximately equal in magnitude to synchronous temporal variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}67), but much lower than spatial variability (log-SD = 1{\textperiodcentered}11). We also show that the pairwise correlation coefficient, a common measure of population synchrony, is approximated by the estimated ratio of shared and total variance, where both approaches yield a synchrony estimate of 0{\textperiodcentered}59. We therefore find evidence for spatial buffering of temporal variability in early juvenile survival, although between-population variability that persists over time is also large. We conclude that spatial variation decreases interannual changes in overall juvenile production, which suggests that conservation and restoration of spatial diversity will improve population persistence for this metapopulation. However, the exact magnitude of spatial buffering depends upon demographic parameters such as adult survival that may vary among populations and is proposed as an area of future research using hierarchical life cycle models. We recommend that future sampling of this metapopulation employ a repeated-measure sampling design to improve estimation of early juvenile carrying capacity.},

In this study, the soil respiration rate (R (s)), soil temperature (T (10)) and soil moisture (SM10) at 10 cm depth were observed in a Korean Larch (Larix olgensis Herry.) plantation in Northeast China from 2008 to 2012. Mean R (s) in growing season (GS) varied greatly, ranged from 2.32 +/- A 0.08 to 3.88 +/- A 0.09 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (mean +/- A SE) over the period of 2008-2012. In comparison with T-model, the increase of explained variability by applying both T (10) and SM10 to the T-M model is very small. It is indicated that R (s) was controlled largely by T (10) in the present study. By accounting for 22.2 and 17.7 % of the total soil CO2 emissions in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012, respectively, the soil CO2 efflux in dormant season (DS) was an essential component of the total soil CO2 efflux. The Q (10) value in the study period was always smaller for GS than DS, suggesting that soil carbon cycling may be more sensitive to the temperature changes at low than at high temperature range. These results indicated that climate changes may have great potential impacts on temperate Larch plantations in Northeast China, owing to soil carbon emissions of Larch plantation during the long period of DS being more sensitive to T (10) than in GS, and played a significant role in the annual forest ecosystems carbon budget.},

To examine spatial and temporal patterns of fish abundance in macrophyte stands we sampled fish bimonthly with fine-meshed fish traps by day and night in giant rush habitats of a River Murray billabong between October 1995 and September 1996. Three native and three exotic species were found within these habitats during the study, however, catches were dominated by two species of native carp gudgeons (Hypseleotris spp.). Consistently higher numbers of gudgeons were trapped during the day than at night throughout the study period and there was a sustained decline in catch from spring in the first year to the following spring. The results suggest recruitment of juvenile fish spawned during the summer was insufficient for relative abundance to return to the high numbers found at the start of the study. Fine-scale distribution of carp gudgeons within emergent macrophytes was not generally explained by variability in either physical structure or physicochemical variability. This contrasts with many studies of small fish assemblages in macrophytes where piscivorous predators are present.},

abstract = {Forage fish undergo dramatic changes in abundance through time. Long-term fluctuations, which have historically been attributed to changes in recruitment, may also be due to changes in adult mortality. Pacific herring, a lightly exploited forage fish in Puget Sound, WA, have exhibited shifts in age structure and decreases in spawning biomass during the past 30 years. Here, we investigate changes in adult mortality as a potential explanation for these shifts. Using a hierarchical, age-structured population model, we indicate that adult natural mortality for Puget Sound Pacific herring has increased since 1973. We find that natural mortality has increased for every age class of adult (age 3+), especially age 4 fish, whose estimated mortality has doubled over the survey time period (from M = 0.84-1.76). We demonstrate that long-term shifts in mortality explain changes in age structure, and may explain biomass declines and failure to reach management thresholds for two spawning sites in Puget Sound (Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass). Temporal shifts in natural adult mortality could have negative implications for herring and herring predators. We demonstrate that adult mortality, in addition to recruitment variation, is an important driver for forage fish, which face exceptionally high natural mortality compared with other fishes.},

abstract = {Interdecadal climate variability complicates fishery science and management. On the U.S. west coast, periods of favorable and adverse conditions may last 30 yrs each. A constant-harvest-rate policy may work for long-lived fishes, (those with life spans comparable to or exceeding the duration of adverse conditions). Exploitation of short-lived fishes (species with life spans shorter than the duration of adverse conditions) benefits from policies that link harvest rate to environmental conditions, but a delayed response can be desirable. Therefore, rapid identification of regime shifts is not necessary but could provide advance notice of long-term changes in expected harvests. Planning horizons, especially for stock rebuilding, may have to be much longer than has been typical, even a century or more. During adverse periods little rebuilding may occur even after total cessation of fishing. Adverse species interactions like intraguild competition or 'cultivation effects' may prolong rebuilding or reduce sustainable yields. Management reference points like F-msy and B-msy can be strongly influenced by abundance of competitors. Importantly, B-msy of large predators may be well above half the unfished biomass if their removal releases smaller competitors. Although adverse interactions may be reversible, rebuilding of apex predators may require decades to centuries.},

abstract = {Diverse and interacting spawning groups of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) have varying degrees of independence to environmental conditions. How these population components respond independently to the same set of environmental conditions, and are connected through straying or entrainment, will contribute to the aggregate metapopulation dynamics. The consequences of connectivity for productivity, stability, and persistence were evaluated in an age-structured model of a two-component metapopulation. Simulation scenarios of straying and entrainment were developed to examine the effects of component interchange and recruitment covariance on metapopulation attributes. Asynchronous component responses should result in reduced variance in metapopulation dynamics, which was measured as the portfolio effect (PE). Most types and magnitudes of connectivity reduced metapopulation productivity and stability. Increased connectivity tended to increase instability of a component by distributing the effect of strong year classes among components and disrupting the "storage effect" within components. Density-dependent straying and entrainment, respectively, showed stabilizing and destabilizing feedback cycles on metapopulation stability and persistence. Furthermore, high rates of connectivity tended to result in increased synchronous responses between components and depressed metapopulation productivity, stability, and PE. Exploitation on a metapopulation should similarly depress independence among components because high mortality will dampen component responses to environmental forcing.},

abstract = { Survival, growth, and juvenile migration timing are key life history traits for at‐risk salmon populations. To estimate these traits in threatened wild Snake River spring–summer Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha , we tagged fish as parr in 3–17 natal streams per year from 1991 to 2003. We injected passive integrated transponder tags into parr collected from streams within the Salmon River basin in Idaho. Each spring, after the previous summer's tagging, fish were detected as smolts in the juvenile fish bypass systems of lower Snake River dams. Estimated parr‐to‐smolt survival to Lower Granite Dam (excluding migration year 1992) ranged from 3% to 48% for individual populations and from 8% to 25% (yearly average = 16%) for all streams combined. From 1998 to 2004, estimated parr‐to‐smolt survival declined from 25% to 8%, in part because of parr density‐dependent effects. Overall annual average growth rates from tagging to detection at Little Goose Dam ranged from 39.7 to 43.3 mm during 2001–2004, and significant differences in growth were observed among sites and years. Growth of individuals was positively related to elapsed time between tagging and recapture and negatively related to fork length at tagging. Annual migration timing distributions for fish populations from the different streams varied highly within and between years. Timing of the 10th to 90th percentile passing Lower Granite Dam ranged from 20 to 45 d for the combined wild populations (average = 38 d). Median passage date was negatively related to autumn temperature, spring temperature, and March river flow, and was positively related to elevation of the tagging site. Baseline data generated by this project provide a foundation for understanding the biocomplexity of these populations, which is critical to effective recovery efforts for these threatened wild fish stocks. },

abstract = {Overfishing is generally considered to be a reduction in biomass below some critical level such that the remaining fish are not able to replenish the population. We propose that the removal of large numbers of older age groups by fishing is also a form of overfishing, which we identify as longevity overfishing. Longevity overfishing is a potentially important consideration for the commercial fisheries off Canada's Pacific coast that are dominated by species that have maximum ages of 30 years or longer. Sablefish is one of the key long-lived species that is managed for biomass and not longevity. An age structured model showed that if younger fish do not have the same productivity per unit biomass as older fish, the population depleted of older fishes would not recover after a shift of carrying capacity from a prolonged period of poor productivity to a more productive ocean ecosystem. Current management of long-lived species implicitly assumes that young fish will have the same productivity as older fishes, an assumption that is not supported by a sparse literature, and is thus not precautionary. We propose that the evolved age structure is an indication that long-lived species must be managed for longevity as well as biomass, which requires a management time frame that is decades and not annual. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Management of spatially structured species poses unique challenges. Despite a strong theoretical foundation, practitioners rarely have sufficient empirical data to evaluate how populations interact. Rather, assumptions about connectivity and source–sink dynamics are often based on incomplete, extrapolated, or modeled data, if such interactions are even considered at all. Therefore, it has been difficult to evaluate whether spatially structured species are meeting conservation goals. We evaluated how estimated metapopulation structure responded to estimates of population sizes and dispersal probabilities and to the set of populations included. We then compared outcomes of alternative management strategies that target conservation of metapopulation processes. We illustrated these concepts for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River, USA. Our description of spatial structure for this metapopulation was consistent with previous characterizations. We found substantial differences in estimated metapopulation structure when we had incomplete information about all populations and when we used different sources of data (three empirical, two modeled) to estimate dispersal, whereas responses to population size estimates were more consistent. Together, these findings suggest that monitoring efforts should target all populations occasionally and populations that play key roles frequently and that multiple types of data should be collected when feasible. When empirical data are incomplete or of uneven quality, analyses using estimates produced from an ensemble of available datasets can help conservation planners and managers weigh near-term options. Doing so, we found trade-offs in connectivity and source dominance in metapopulation-level responses to alternative management strategies that suggest which types of approaches may be inherently less risky.},

abstract = {Metapopulation structure is typically thought to increase regional species abundance, promote population persistence, and aid in the re-establishment of extirpated populations. However, the underlying theoretical models tended to assume high productivity, making the conservation benefit of metapopulation structure uncertain for endangered species with low productivity. We simulated population assemblages (N = 50) of diadromous fishes under high to low productivity scenarios to explicitly assess how straying (movement from natal to non-natal rivers) contributes to changes in species abundance and extinction risk. The population aggregation exhibited greater total abundance from source–sink dynamics and also exhibited the rescue effect when productivity remained moderately high. However, straying did not ensure persistence of nonviable populations or enable population re-establishment when productivity was low. These results were robust to a wide range of alternate spatial and life-history parameterizations of the simulation model. Relative to a real-world population aggregation of endangered Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), our results would argue for a shift in remediation priorities to prevent extinction. Although there is strong evolutionary justification for maintaining widespread distributions of endangered diadromous species, the immediate numerical consequences of this approach may hinder recovery.},

abstract = {Mixed-stock fisheries simultaneously exploit populations that may differ in their conservation status, and uncertainty in stock-specific harvest rates can hamper evaluations of recovery prospects for depressed populations. These difficulties are exemplified in the Sockeye Salmon population from the Atnarko watershed, which collapsed in the early 2000s, causing cultural and economic hardship. A recovery plan identified the incidental harvest of Sockeye Salmon by mixed-stock fisheries in the Atnarko as a potential, but poorly understood, impediment to recovery. We reconstructed harvest rates for salmon in Indigenous and commercial fisheries and used an age-structured state-space model of stock–recruit dynamics to predict how a range of future mixed-stock harvest rates would influence recovery. Under recent harvest rates, there is a 50–60% chance that the population will grow to exceed a recovery goal of 15,000 spawners over the next four generations. Eliminating the harvest of Sockeye Salmon altogether increased predicted recovery prospects to a maximum of 69%, suggesting that factors other than fisheries are contributing to the lack of recovery (e.g., ocean conditions) and that harvest management alone is unlikely to lead to recovery with a high degree of certainty. We developed a generalized migration, harvest, and catch monitoring simulation model to quantify how different monitoring scenarios might improve estimates for mixed-stock harvest rates. Increasing the number of specimens collected for genetic samples improved the harvest rate estimates for each stock caught in the mixed-stock fisheries, particularly for the smallest stocks, and relative to single sampling events conducted near the peak of the return migration, weekly sampling improved estimates only slightly but provided insurance against missing the peak of the return migration. Our study highlights collaborative research initiated and directed by the Nuxalk Nation to promote the recovery of a depressed stock that is inherent to traditional foods, thereby contributing to a global effort to integrate Indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

abstract = {Contemporary economic thinking does not acknowledge that the human economy is embedded in Nature; it instead treats humanity as a customer that draws on Nature. In this paper, we present a grammar for economic reasoning that is not built on that error. The grammar is based on a comparison between our demand for Nature's maintenance and regulating services and her ability to supply them on a sustainable basis. The comparison is then used to show that for measuring economic well-being, national statistical offices should estimate an inclusive measure of their economies' wealth and its distribution, not GDP and its distribution. The concept of 'inclusive wealth' is then used to identify policy instruments that ought to be used to manage such global public goods as the open seas and tropical rainforests. Trade liberalization without heed paid to the fate of local ecosystems from which primary products are drawn and exported by developing countries leads to a transfer of inclusive wealth from there to rich importing countries. Humanity's embeddedness in Nature has far-reaching implications for the way we should view human activities - in households, communities, nations and the world.

Both theory and empirical information support the conclusion that most density-de-pendent change occurs at high population levels (close to the carrying capacity) for species with life history strategies typical of large mammals. The reverse is true for species with life history strategies typical of insects and some fishes. Theoretical considerations that give rise to these conclusions involve natural selection and trophic dynamics. There is a large body of literature that contains descriptions of density dependence as based on empirical observations. These data, and the models used to represent them, indicate that species with high reproductive rates, short life-spans and pop-ulations held below the limits of environmental resources exhibit most density-dependent change at low population levels. Similar data for species with low reproductive rates, long life-spans and pop-ulations that are more limited by resources (large mammals in particular) indicate that most density-dependent changes in vital rates occur at levels of the population quite close to the carrying capacity.},

To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world's 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16%), and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1%), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58% of stocks with reference points (n=214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30% had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, average weight of fish caught was lowest during peak macrophyte coverage, but no differences in weight-per-hour of fish caught were evident. The amount of effort to catch a memorable-size ( greater than or equal to 2.27 kg) largemouth bass varied inversely with macrophyte abundance. We hypothesized that angling vulnerability of these larger fish likely declined due to the refuge provided by plant cover.

abstract = {Marine hypoxia has had major consequences for both economically and ecologically critical fish species around the world. As hypoxic regions continue to grow in severity and extent, we must deepen our understanding of mechanisms driving population and community responses to major stressors. It has been shown that food availability and habitat use are the most critical components of impacts on individual fish leading to observed outcomes at higher levels of organization. However, differences within and among species in partitioning available energy for metabolic demands – or metabolic prioritization – in response to stressors are often ignored. Here, I use both a multispecies size spectrum model and a meta-analysis to explore evidence in favor of metabolic prioritization in a community of commercially important fish species in the Baltic Sea. Modeling results suggest that metabolic prioritization is an important component of the individual response to hypoxia, that it interacts with other components to produce realistic community dynamics, and that different species may prioritize differently. It is thus suggested that declines in feeding activity, assimilation efficiency, and successful reproduction – in addition to low food availability and changing habitat use – are all important drivers of the community response to hypoxia. Meta-analysis results also provide evidence that the dominant predator in the study system prioritizes among metabolic demands, and that these priorities may change as oxygen declines. Going forward, experiments and models should explore how differences in priorities within and among communities drive responses to environmental degradation. This will help management efforts to tailor recovery programs to the physiological needs of species within a given system.},

abstract = {Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) are the dominant piscivore in western Lake Erie and provide valuable sport and commercial fisheries in Canada and the United States. Historical records of their abundance reflect unstable levels of recruitment primarily due to highly variable year-class formation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying variable year-class strength formation of reef-spawned walleye in western Lake Erie, I sampled walleye eggs on mid-lake reefs (Cone, Crib, Locust Pt., Niagara, Round and Toussaint) and larvae on and adjacent to the reefs from 1994 through 1999. Reefs varied in depth and size and egg sampling was stratified by depth. Larval sampling sites extended from Maumee Bay to the Bass Islands complex and were stratified by depth and distance from shore. The initiation of spawning was generally consistent, beginning in the first week of April, although spawning began noticeably earlier in mid-March 1998. Egg abundance varied among reefs and between years. Shallow sites on reefs had higher egg relative abundance early in the incubation period but this trend reversed later in April and early May as eggs were removed from exposed shallow areas on reefs by currents and predators. Egg viability was generally lowest early in egg incubation periods and showed an increasing trend as incubation progressed. Abundance of egg predators increased after peak egg abundance occurred. Egg survival was generally highest in years when lake waters warmed quickly and few wind events occurred during incubation periods. Egg survival was also higher for cohorts of eggs spawned later in the spawning season due to quicker incubation rates. Analysis of recruitment indices from 1960–1997 indicate that a water warming of at least 0.2°C/day during egg incubation periods is necessary for good year-classes to form.    Abundance, growth, and survival of larval walleye varied between years and was positively related to egg abundance and survival, water temperature, and prey abundance. Larvae became concentrated in shallow nearshore areas of western Lake Eric. These areas were warmer, darker, and had higher abundance of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton prey than offshore areas. Abundance of demersal age-0 walleye in October index bottom trawl surveys was highest in 1996 (30.8/h trawling), a year with moderately high egg abundance (7,230/tow), good egg survival (21%), moderately high larval abundance (8.1/1,000 m 3), good larval growth (0.34 mm/day), and exceptional larval survival (72%). The weakest year class was formed in 1995 when the October bottom trawl index was only 0.2/hour of trawling. This year had low egg abundance (3,610/tow), low egg survival (0.105), low larval abundance (3.5/1,000 m3), slow larval growth (0.31 mm/day), and low larval survival (36.5%). This research emphasizes the importance of physical processes like wind and water warming rate in tempering the environmental setting that biological processes take place. Further, this study exposed specific nearshore areas in western Lake Erie important as nursery zones for walleye.},

abstract = {The need to transition from traditional single-species fisheries management approaches towards ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), or an ecosystem approach to fisheries, is widely recognised. EBFM is particularly important when considering management actions for economically valuable fisheries for small pelagic forage fish, given their key ecological role. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is an effective approach to advance the quantitative implementation of EBFM by enabling stakeholders to explore trade-offs among competing ecosystem-related objectives. This paper puts forward six different approaches to advance EBFM with MSE explicity, by taking advantage of data and research already available and by guiding future research. These approaches can be grouped into those which (i) involve the operating model and/or link directly to the operating model while potentially providing additional performance metrics to evaluate ecosystem objectives, (ii) can be incorporated into the performance metrics, and (iii) involve the harvest control rule of the management procedure. This review demonstrates that immediate steps can be taken to implement EBFM targeted at quantitative tactical management, even without a complex, data-rich ecosystem operating model.},

abstract = {Life history strategy models in which female size depends on fecundity and male size on male-male competition, are used to predict male and female size. Sperm competition alone?without any form of contest competition?cannot readily generate size ratios (male weight/female weight) greater than 1{\textperiodcentered}0, and if sperm competition is very weak, small or even dwarf males are predicted. Increasing sperm competition increases male size, but only with high numbers of competing males can male size approach that of females. Size dimorphism is also affected by the ratio: growth rate/mortality rate in each sex. If this is higher in one sex, its size increases. Two trade-offs in fish could affect this ratio but neither appears likely to yield size ratios above unity under sperm competition. Male-male combat is capable of pushing male size beyond that of females, but male size seems never to exceed female size by more than one order of ten, whilst the reverse can proceed to many orders of ten (dwarf males), a pattern which applies generally in animals. Reasons for this asymmetry in size ratio include buffering effects of reducing growth rate (?von Bertalanffy buffering?), and an asymmetry in the homeostatic effect of operational sex ratio (?OSR buffering?). High adult male mortality and weak male-male competition can generate dwarf males. A fundamental problem concerns why the sexes are often so similar in size: this may relate to sperm competition, size buffering effects, and many other features not considered in the present models.},

abstract = {Understanding population dynamics is essential for achieving sustainable and productive fisheries. However, estimating recruitment in a stock assessment model involves the challenging task of identifying a self-sustaining population, which often includes representing complex geographic structure. A review of several case studies demonstrated that alternative stock assessment models can influence estimates of recruitment. Incorporating spatial population structure and connectivity into stock assessment models changed the perception of recruitment events for a wide diversity of fisheries, but the degree to which estimates were impacted depended on movement rates and relative stock sizes. For multiple population components, estimates of strong recruitment events and the productivity of smaller population units were often more sensitive to connectivity assumptions. Simulation testing, conditioned on these case studies, suggested that accurately accounting for population structure, either in management unit definitions or stock assessment model structure, improved recruitment estimates. An understanding of movement dynamics improved estimation of connected sub-populations. The challenge of representing geographic structure in stock assessment emphasizes the importance of defining self-sustaining management units to justify a unit-stock assumption.},

abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

abstract = {Summary1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies.Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, espe-cially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors fortreatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly availablein a standard linear model.2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretabilityof regression coeﬃcients. Further, reﬁtting the model with a slightly modiﬁed model structureallows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model.3. Centring will make main eﬀects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactionsand thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main eﬀects. This also applies to the estimationof linear eﬀects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred andthis sometimes assists interpretation.4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardizedslopes or standardized partial regression coeﬃcients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magni-tude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlationcoeﬃcients and are often the more interesting standardized eﬀect size.5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main eﬀects allows extracting treatment means or treat-ment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a sim-ple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and maineﬀects.6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates aswell as conﬁdence intervals) rather than on signiﬁcance thresholds. They allow ﬁtting complex, butmeaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can alsobe applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.Key-words: conﬁdence intervals, generalized linear models, interaction term s, null hypo-thesis testing, partial correlation coefﬁcients, partial regression coefﬁcients, standard errors,standardized effects sizes},

abstract = {Scale transition theory is an approach to understanding population and community dynamics in the presence of spatial or temporal variation in environmental factors or population densities. It focuses on changes in the equations for population dynamics as the scale enlarges. These changes are explained in terms of interactions between nonlinearities and variation on lower scales, and they predict the emergence of new properties on larger scales that are not predicted by lower scale dynamics in the absence of variation on those lower scales. These phenomena can be understood in terms of statistical inequalities arising from the process of nonlinear averaging, which translates the rules for dynamics from lower to higher scales. Nonlinearities in population dynamics are expressions of the fundamental biology of the interactions between individual organisms. Variation that interacts with these nonlinearities also involves biology fundamentally in several different ways. First, there are the aspects of biology that are sensitive to variation in space or time. These determine which aspects of a nonlinear dynamical equation are affected by variation, and whether different individuals or different species are sensitive to different extents or to different aspects of variation. Second is the nature of the variation, for example, whether it is variation in the physical environment or variation in population densities. From the interplay between variation and nonlinearities in population dynamics, scale transition theory builds a theory of changes in dynamics with changes in scale. In this article, the focus is on spatial variation, and the theory is illustrated with examples relevant to the dynamics of insect communities. In these communities, one commonly occurring nonlinear relationship is a negative exponential relationship between survival of an organism and the densities of natural enemies or competitors. This negative exponential has a biological origin in terms of independent actions of many individuals. The subsequent effects of spatial variation can be represented naturally in terms of Laplace transforms and related statistical transforms to obtain both analytical solutions and an extra level of understanding. This process allows us to analyze the meaning and effects of aggregation of insects in space. Scale transition theory more generally, however, does not aim to have fully analytical solutions but partial analytical solutions applicable for circumstances too complex for full analytical solution. These partial solutions are intended to provide a framework for understanding of numerical solutions, simulations and field studies where key quantities can be estimated from empirical data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web's interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists' responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

abstract = {To inform the design of MPA networks and ensure that they will meet stated goals, spatially explicit metapopulation models are often used to simulate the response of fished species to MPA implementation. Typically, such models are simply spatial extensions of traditional, nonspatial population models used in fisheries management. A common assumption used in making this transition is that R′(0), the slope at the origin of the nonspatial, population-wide egg-recruit relationship (often termed the steepness or compensation ratio), can be used to estimate $\alpha$, the slope at the origin of the small-scale settler-recruit relationship used in spatially explicit models. This assumption is not always correct. In particular, the value of R′(0) often implicitly accounts for a variety of processes spanning the egg-recruit transition, including larval mortality and advection away from suitable habitat. If a spatial model accounts for some of those loss processes explicitly, such as by using an oceanographically realistic dispersal matrix, it becomes necessary to adjust the estimate of $\alpha$ upwards to avoid double-counting those losses. Here I present a simple correction involving the dominant eigenvalue of the dispersal matrix that adjusts the value of R′(0) to avoid this error. Applying this correction factor ensures that a spatially explicit model will predict population collapse at the same level of fishing implied by a large-scale estimate of R′(0). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

They are characterized by high water vapor content and strong low level winds, and form a part of the broader warm conveyor belt of extratropical cyclones. Although the meridional water vapor transport within ARs is critical for water resources, ARs can also cause disastrous floods especially when encountering mountainous terrain. They were labeled as atmospheric rivers in the 1990s, and have since become a well-studied feature of the midlatitude climate.

Seven release experiments (53 stocking events) are analysed, using a survival model based on allometric mortality and linear-length growth, allowing variation between experiments in both the allometric exponent and the level of mortality at reference length or generalising in one or both of the parameters. Results support the existence of a consistent allometry that applies independently of the overall level of mortality. The best-performing model is one in which the length exponent of mortality is set to -1 a priori, while mortality at reference length is allowed to vary between experiments (ranging from 0.7 to 33 per year at 15 cm in the present study). Even though the allometry of mortality is constant, the relative survival advantage of stocking large fish increases with the level of mortality at reference length. Using the identified length exponent of mortality of -1, survival models are derived for the linear, exponential, and von Bertalanffy growth equations. The models can be used to assess alternative release sizes, given an estimate of mortality at reference length, to facilitate comparative studies and to aid in the design of release experiments.},

Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha exposed as alevins were very susceptible to infection; the appearance of clinical signs, prevalence of infection, severity of microscopic lesions, and spore counts at 130 d postexposure are similar to those of age-matched rainbow trout O. mykiss exposed at the same dose. In contrast, coho salmon O. kisutch demonstrated no clinical signs of infection and had a lower prevalence of infection and spore numbers than did the exposed rainbow trout. A comparison of two strains of steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout), one from an enzootic site (San Lorenzo River) where M. cerebralis has been present for the past 35 years and a second from a site where the parasite is not found (Dry Creek), showed them both to be highly susceptible to experimental infections with M. cerebralis. These controlled experimental exposures demonstrated that although certain species of anadromous salmonids (e.g., coho salmon) may resist the ill effects of whirling disease, other species (chinook salmon and steelhead) are highly susceptible to infection and disease. We anticipate that severe and negative impacts at the population level might occur among certain anadromous salmonids when conditions favor exposure of early life stages to high levels of M. cerebralis},

The results showed a decline in productivity irrespective of the model chosen and the way in which the pre- and postdam periods were defined. However, the data were noisy and the confidence bounds on parameter estimates were fairly large. To reconcile the different management goals derived from the different data sources (adult or juvenile data) or model choice (Ricker or Beverton–Holt), we used simulation techniques and Bayesian algorithms. The combined approach suggests a recovery management goal (i.e., spawning stock associated with themaximum sustainable yield) of 60,000 steelhead above Lower Granite Dam. At current smolt-to-adult survival rates, the data indicate optimal escapement of between 20,000 and 27,000 adults.

abstract = {Large woody debris (LWD) performs key functions in undisturbed streams that drain lowland forested watersheds, including dissipation of flow energy, stabilization of bedforms and channel banks, entrapment of sediment, and formation of pools. These functions vary between individual channels, however, depending on the size and morphology of the stream, which in turn depend on climate, watershed size, valley slope, geologic substrate, and relative inputs of water and sediment. Loss of LWD will alter channel form and processes, yielding greater sediment fluxes, more rapid bank erosion and incision, and loss of heterogeneity in bed morphology. Just as LWD is ubiquitous in undisturbed lowland streams of the Pacific Northwest, it is significantly depleted in urbanized systems where it is lost through washout, downcutting, and direct removal. Given the dramatic changes in runoff processes and sediment delivery that typify urban watersheds, we doubt that simple reintroduction of LWD will fully restore the lost functions of urban streams. Instead, projects that replace LWD may be best suited to recover a more limited set of rehabilitation goals; they are also necessary components of more comprehensive restoration efforts in once-forested lowland landscapes. Project designs range from the visually pleasing to the hydraulically engineered, but most approaches nonetheless fail rapidly in a dynamic stream environment. Stable configurations of LWD are best recognized through the careful observation of form and riverine context in natural systems, where years of varying water and sediment discharges have obliterated all but the most stable arrangements.},

abstract = {Sea otter populations in Southeast Alaska, USA, have increased dramatically from just over 400 translocated animals in the late 1960s to >8,000 by 2003. The recovery of sea otters to ecosystems from which they had been absent has affected coastal food webs, including commercially important fisheries, and thus information on expected growth and equilibrium abundances can help inform resource management. We compile available survey data for Southeast Alaska and fit a Bayesian state-space model to estimate past trends and current abundance. Our model improves upon previous analyses by partitioning and quantifying sources of estimation error, accounting for over-dispersion of aerial count data, and providing realistic measurements of uncertainty around point estimates of abundance at multiple spatial scales. We also provide estimates of carrying capacity (K) for Southeast Alaska, at regional and sub-regional scales, and analyze growth rates, current population status and expected future trends. At the regional scale, the population increased from 13,221 otters in 2003 to 25,584 otters in 2011. The average annual growth rate in southern Southeast Alaska (7.8%) was higher than northern Southeast Alaska (2.7%); however, growth varied at the sub-regional scale and there was a negative relationship between growth rates and the number of years sea otters were present in an area. Local populations vary in terms of current densities and expected future growth; the mean estimated density at K was 4.2 ± 1.58 sea otters/km2 of habitat (i.e., the sub-tidal benthos between 0 m and 40 m depth) and current densities correspond on average to 50% of projected equilibrium values (range = 1–97%) with the earliest-colonized sub-regions tending to be closer to K. Assuming a similar range of equilibrium densities for currently un-occupied habitats, the projected value of K for all of Southeast Alaska is 74,650 sea otters. Future analyses can improve upon the precision of K estimates by employing more frequent surveys at index sites and incorporating environmental covariates into the process model to generate more accurate, location-specific estimates of equilibrium density. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {—We sought to determine whether electrofishing catchability was density dependent and varied with physical and biological factors for walleyes Sander vitreus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, smallmouth bass M. dolomieu, northern pike Esox lucius, and muskellunge E. masquinongy in Wisconsin lakes. Electrofishing catch rate (number of fish caught per shoreline mile) was linearly related to population density (number of fish per acre) in spring for largemouth bass, northern pike, and muskellunge and in fall for walleyes, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass. In contrast, gear saturation caused the electrofishing catch rate to be nonlinearly related (hyperstable) to population density for walleyes and smallmouth bass during spring. Catchability was higher during spring than fall for walleyes, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass. Catchability of walleyes during fall was positively related to the percentage of littoral zone, whereas catchability of largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and muskellunge was negatively related to the shoreline development index. Other physical and chemical variables failed to describe significant residual variation in catchability of any other species in any other season. We conclude that population density cannot be accurately estimated from the electrofishing catch rates of walleyes and small-mouth bass during spring. Therefore, mark–recapture methods must still be used to estimate population density if managers choose to sample those species during spring in Wisconsin lakes. Fisheries surveys often rely on the assumption that the catch rate is linearly related to population density and can therefore be used to index popu-lation density via the equation C N ϭ q ϫ , f A where C ϭ catch, f ϭ fishing effort, q ϭ catcha-bility, N ϭ fish abundance, and A ϭ the area oc-cupied by the fish stock when catchability is con-stant (Ricker 1975; Richards and Schnute 1986; Newby et al. 2000; Hansen et al. 2004). However, gear saturation and nonrandom searching effort may cause catchability to vary with population density (Peterman and Steer 1981; Hansen et al. 2004). Furthermore, tests of nonlinearity between catch rate (C/f) and population density (N/A) are problematic because density is measured with er-ror, thereby producing biased estimates of catch-ability when ordinary least-squares (OLS) regres-sion is used (Ricker 1975; Hansen et al. 2004).},

abstract = {Abstract
The adoption of the Precautionary Approach requires providing advice that is robust to uncertainty. Therefore, when conducting stock assessment alternative, model structures and data sets are commonly considered. The primary diagnostics used to compare models are to examine residuals patterns to check goodness-of-fit and to conduct retrospective analysis to check the stability of estimates. However, residual patterns can be removed by adding more parameters than justified by the data, and retrospective patterns removed by ignoring the data. Therefore, neither alone can be used for validation, which requires assessing whether it is plausible that a system identical to the model generated the data. Therefore, we use hindcasting to estimate prediction skill, a measure of the accuracy of a predicted value unknown by the model relative to its observed value, to explore model misspecification and data conflicts. We compare alternative model structures based on integrated statistical and Bayesian state-space biomass dynamic models using, as an example, Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna. Validation is not a binary process (i.e. pass or fail) but a continuum; therefore, we discuss the use of prediction skill to identify alternative hypotheses, weight ensemble models and agree on reference sets of operating models when conducting Management Strategy Evaluation.},

abstract = {In 1993, six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) had collapsed to the point where a moratorium was declared on fishing. It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment of cod to the fishery. Yet we are unable to detect a difference between the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of 20%. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as determined by research surveys and reconstructed from the commercial catch at age data (called ''virtual population analysis'' [VPA]) for each stock. VPA-based abundances consistently depict lower recruitment levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend. One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality. This is consistent with the discarding hypothesis. We suggest that age-specific abundance trends estimated from research surveys and VPA should be compared for all stocks where such data exist, and that high priority should, be given to the measurement of discarding levels and the extent to which catch misreporting is related to changes in fishing mortality.},

Some, however, stray into nonnatal habitats and interact (e.g., reproduce) with individuals from other populations. Pacific salmon straying has been heavily studied for several decades, particularly from the perspective of the populations that donate the stray migrants. Conservation consequences are experienced primarily by the populations that receive strays, though, and there is recent evidence of significant levels of genetic introgression in small recipient populations, which could contribute to the loss of local adaptations. Straying may also provide the benefit of a demographic rescue effect that could save declining recipient populations from extirpation. We highlight the influence of population abundances on the magnitude of straying into recipient populations and demonstrate this using evidence we collected from a small population of Sockeye Salmon O. nerka in British Columbia, Canada. We also review potential factors that might promote higher donor stray rates and therefore recipient straying. Evidence of factors that affect straying is limited and we identify several knowledge gaps, as well as anthropogenic activities that could promote straying. We encourage further discussion and research on the potential effects of recipient straying and the factors that affect straying rates.},

A total of 13,897 tagged fish have been released, with 228 recoveries reported during 1992–2016. Of the returned tags, 19% traveled <2M (nm) between tagging and recovery location, 36% traveled 2–5nm, 18% traveled 6–10nm, 12% traveled 11–50nm, 4% traveled 51–100nm, and 11% traveled >100nm. While a small percentage of tagged shortspine thornyhead traveled large distances, at times crossing management and international boundaries, the low movement rate indicates that the current scale of management for shortspine thornyhead rockfish in Alaska appears to be appropriate.},

abstract = {To facilitate pipeline transport of bitumen, it is diluted with natural gas condensate, and the resulting mixture, "dilbit", differs greatly in chemical composition to conventional crude oil. Despite the risk of accidental dilbit release, the effects of dilbit on aquatic animals are largely unknown. In this study, we compared the toxicity of water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of dilbit and two conventional crude oils, medium sour composite and mixed sweet blend, to developing zebrafish. Mortality and pericardial edema was lowest in dilbit WAF-exposed embryonic zebrafish but yolk sac edema was similar in all exposures. Shelter-seeking behavior was decreased by dilbit and conventional crude WAF exposures, and continuous swimming behavior was affected by all tested WAF exposures. Regardless of WAF type, monoaromatic hydrocarbon content (largely made up of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX)) was a more accurate predictor of lethality and pericardial edema than polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. Our results suggest that the toxicity of dilbit to a model fish is less than or similar to that of conventional crudes.},

The seasonal dynamics of body condition (BC), circulating corticosterone levels (baseline, BL) and the adrenocortical response to acute stress (SR) were examined in long-lived Black-legged Kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, breeding at Duck (food-poor colony) and Gull (food-rich colony) Islands in lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. It was tested whether the dynamics of corticosterone levels reflect a seasonal change in bird physiological condition due to reproduction and/or variation in foraging conditions. 2. BC declined seasonally, and the decline was more pronounced in birds at the food-poor colony. BL and SR levels of corticosterone rose steadily through the reproductive season, and BL levels were significantly higher in birds on Duck island compared with those on Gull Island. During the egg-laying and chick-rearing stages, birds had lower SR on Duck Island than on Gull Island. 3. The results suggest that, in addition to a seasonal change in bird physiology during reproduction, local ecological factors such as food availability affect circulating levels of corticosterone and adrenal response to acute stress.},

abstract = {Landscape change may reduce the connectivity of landscapes and impact the movement of animals. If movement processes have been influenced by landscape connectivity, we hypothesize that animals may distribute themselves in larger connected regions of the landscape in order to minimize the movement costs associated with obtaining required resources and avoiding predators. We adopt the term functional grain to describe a set of functionally connected regions. In this spatial pattern, each region describes a contiguous area of the landscape within which an animal may move freely below a threshold amount of movement cost. We used telemetry data from woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou to test hypothetical functional grains where connectivity was determined by the spatial configuration of resource patches (patch only), by the resistance to movement presented by landscape features (resistance only), and by a combination of the two (patch + resistance). To identify these functional grains, we used a grains of connectivity approach, and introduced a novel lattice-based variant of this method to build the resistance only model. We developed a measure of fit that describes caribou distribution with respect to larger functionally connected regions in the grain, and used this to ask: 1) are seasonal caribou locations consistent with a random functional grain, implying that landscape connectivity has not shaped their distribution? 2) Given a functional grain model, are seasonal caribou locations distributed in larger functionally connected regions than random points, implying a response to the shape, size, and location of the connected regions. We found support for landscape connectivity influencing animal distribution using grains based on a landscape resistance model, and that support varied between behaviourally defined seasons. We also discuss how our novel lattice approach may be valuable for highly mobile mammals and other species where the identification of resource patches is a limitation.},

abstract = {Network analysis is on the rise across scientific disciplines because of its ability to reveal complex, and often emergent, patterns and dynamics. Nonetheless, a growing concern in network analysis is the use of limited data for constructing networks. This concern is strikingly relevant to ecology and conservation biology, where network analysis is used to infer connectivity across landscapes. In this context, movement among patches is the crucial parameter for interpreting connectivity but because of the difficulty of collecting reliable movement data, most network analysis proceeds with only indirect information on movement across landscapes rather than using observed movement to construct networks. Statistical models developed for social networks provide promising alternatives for landscape network construction because they can leverage limited movement information to predict linkages. Using two mark-recapture datasets on individual movement and connectivity across landscapes, we test whether commonly used network constructions for interpreting connectivity can predict actual linkages and network structure, and we contrast these approaches to social network models. We find that currently applied network constructions for assessing connectivity consistently, and substantially, overpredict actual connectivity, resulting in considerable overestimation of metapopulation lifetime. Furthermore, social network models provide accurate predictions of network structure, and can do so with remarkably limited data on movement. Social network models offer a flexible and powerful way for not only understanding the factors influencing connectivity but also for providing more reliable estimates of connectivity and metapopulation persistence in the face of limited data.},

Much of the research in fisheries-induced evolution has focussed on quantifying and proving that an evolutionary response has taken place, but less effort has been invested on the actual processes and traits underlying capture of a fish by a fishing gear. This knowledge is not only needed to understand possible phenotypic selection associated to fishing but also to help to device sustainable fisheries and management strategies. Here, we draw attention to the existing knowledge about selectivity of fishing gears and outline the ways in which this information could be utilized in the context of fisheries-induced evolution. To these ends, we will introduce a mathematical framework commonly applied to quantify fishing gear selectivity, illustrate the link between gear selectivity and the change in the distribution of phenotypes induced by fishing, review what is known about selectivity of commonly used fishing gears, and discuss how this knowledge could be applied to improve attempts to predict evolutionary impacts of fishing.},

abstract = {Landscape features exist at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and these naturally affect spatial genetic structure and our ability to make inferences about gene flow. This article discusses how decisions about sampling of genotypes (including choices about analytical methods and genetic markers) should be driven by the scale of spatial genetic structure, the time frame that landscape features have existed in their current state, and all aspects of a species' life history. Researchers should use caution when making inferences about gene flow, especially when the spatial extent of the study area is limited. The scale of sampling of the landscape introduces different features that may affect gene flow. Sampling grain should be smaller than the average home-range size or dispersal distance of the study organism and, for raster data, existing research suggests that simplifying the thematic resolution into discrete classes may result in low power to detect effects on gene flow. Therefore, the methods used to characterize the landscape between sampling sites may be a primary determinant for the spatial scale at which analytical results are applicable, and the use of only one sampling scale for a particular statistical method may lead researchers to overlook important factors affecting gene flow. The particular analytical technique used to correlate landscape data and genetic data may also influence results; common landscape-genetic methods may not be suitable for all study systems, particularly when the rate of landscape change is faster than can be resolved by common molecular markers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Forecasts of climate impacts on ecosystems are far more challenging and their uncertainties even larger because of a limited understanding of physical controls on biological systems. Management and conservation plans that explicitly account for changing climate are rare and even those generally rely on retrospective analyses rather than future scenarios of climatic conditions and associated responses of specific ecosystems. Using past biophysical relationships as a guide to predicting the impacts of future climate change assumes that the observed relationships will remain constant. However, this assumption involves a long chain of uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions, climate sensitivity to changes in greenhouse gases, and the ecological consequences of climate change. These uncertainties in forecasting biological responses to changing climate highlight the need for resource management and conservation policies that are robust to unknowns and responsive to change. We suggest how policy might develop despite substantial uncertainties about the future state of salmon ecosystems.},

abstract = {Recruitment is one of the most variable biological processes driving fisheries population dynamics and the characteristics and drivers of the variation differ among stocks. Understanding, describing (modeling), estimating, and predicting (forecasting) this variation is essential to appropriate stock assessment and fisheries management. Most modern stock assessments estimate annual variation in recruitment, particularly those that include age or size composition data. Changes over time are often partitioned into those related to the spawning biomass due to density dependence (the stock-recruitment relationship) and those related to other factors such as environmental conditions. Several methods have been used to model recruitment inside stock assessment models, and they differ by how recruitment is represented and how statistical inference is conducted. Virtual population analyses make few statistical assumptions about recruitment and instead calculate recruitment as the sum of the mortality-adjusted catches of a cohort while surplus production models generally imply a stock-recruitment relationship in their production function. Integrated statistical stock assessment models have modelled recruitment using a stock-recruitment relationship, autocorrelation, a function of covariates, regime shifts, or a combination of these. Statistical inference has typically been conducted using state-space (hierarchical) models, whether using Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods, or inferences are approximated using penalized likelihood approaches, which may not be statistically reliable. All these methods have specific issues that need to be addressed and there are tradeoffs in their use. Future temporal variation also needs to be considered when providing management advice. We review the theory and practice of modelling temporal variation in recruitment in fisheries stock assessment, provide advice on good practices, and recommend important research.},

We provide the first theoretical basis for identifying species at risk of magnified effects from multiple stressors across life history. By applying a population modeling framework, we reveal conditions under which population responses from stressors applied to distinct life stages are either magnified (synergistic) or mitigated. We find that magnification or mitigation critically depends on the shape of density dependence, but not the life stage in which it occurs. Stressors are always magnified when density dependence is linear or concave, and magnified or mitigated when it is convex. Using Bayesian numerical methods, we estimated the shape of density dependence for eight species across diverse taxa, finding support for all three shapes.},

abstract = {Abstract In view of the bewildering diversity of landscapes and possible patterns therein, our objectives were to see if a useful modeling method for directly comparing land mosaics could be developed based on graph theory, and whether basic spatial patterns could be identified that are common to diverse landscapes. The models developed were based on the spatial configuration of and interactions between landscape elements (ecosystems, land uses or ecotopes). Nodes represented landscape elements and linkages represented common boundaries between elements. Corridors, corridor intersections, and the matrix were successfully incorporated in the models. Twenty-five landscape graphs were constructed from aerial photographs chosen solely to represent a breadth of climates, land uses and human population densities. Seven distinctive clusters of nodes and linkages were identified and common, three of which, in the forms of a spider, necklace and graph cell, were in >90% of the graphs. These represented respectively the following configurations of patches, corridors and matrix: (1) a matrix area surrounding or adjoining many patches; (2) a corridor bisecting a heterogeneous area; and (3) a unit in a network of intersecting corridors. The models also indicated that the connectivity or number of linkages for several common elements, such as fields and house clearings, was relatively constant across diverse landscapes, and that linear shaped elements such as roads and rivers were the most connected. Several additional uses of this graph modeling, including compatibility with systems dynamics models, are pinpointed. Thus the method is useful in allowing simple direct comparisons of any scale and any landscape to help identify patterns and principles. A focus on the common and uncommon configurations should enhance our understanding of fluxes across landscapes, and consequently the quality of land planning and management.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances and habitat degradation are major factors influencing the dynamics and persistence of many wildlife populations, yet few large-scale studies have explored the relative influence of these factors on the dynamics and persistence of animal populations. We used longterm demographic data and matrix population models to examine the potential effects of habitat degradation and natural disturbances on the dynamics of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. We found that estimates of stochastic population growth rate were low (0.90). Population growth rate ($\lambda$) during the first half or our study period (1992 to 1998) was substantially greater than during the second half (1999 to 2005). These 2 periods were characterized by contrasting hydrological conditions. Although $\lambda$ was most sensitive to changes in adult survival, the analysis of life table response experiments revealed that a reduction in fertility of kites accounted for >80% of the observed decline in population growth rate. We examined the possibility that the reduction in $\lambda$ was caused by (1) habitat degradation due to management, (2) an increase in frequency of moderate drying events in recent years, and (3) both habitat degradation and an increase in frequency of moderate drying events. Our results suggest that both factors could potentially contribute to a large decrease in population growth rate. Our study highlights the importance of simultaneously considering short- and long-term effects of disturbances when modeling population dynamics. Indeed, focusing exclusively on one type of effect may be misleading to both our understanding of the ecological dynamics of the system and to management. The relevance of our results to management is heightened because the snail kite has been selected as a key performance measure of one of the most ambitious ecosystem restoration projects ever undertaken. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {Spatial complexity in metacommunities can be separated into 3 main components: size (i.e., number of habitat patches), spatial arrangement of habitat patches (network topology), and diversity of habitat patch types. Much attention has been paid to lattice-type networks, such as patch-based metapopulations, but interest in understanding ecological networks of alternative geometries is building. Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) include some increasingly threatened ecological systems, such as caves and streams. The restrictive architecture of dendritic ecological networks might have overriding implications for species persistence. I used a modeling approach to investigate how number and spatial arrangement of habitat patches influence metapopulation extinction risk in 2 DENs of different size and topology. Metapopulation persistence was higher in larger networks, but this relationship was mediated by network topology and the dispersal pathways used to navigate the network. Larger networks, especially those with greater topological complexity, generally had lower extinction risk than smaller and less-complex networks, but dispersal bias and magnitude affected the shape of this relationship. Applying these general results to real systems will require empirical data on the movement behavior of organisms and will improve our understanding of the implications of network complexity on population and community patterns and processes},

abstract = {Monitoring changes in animal population size is rarely possible through complete censuses; fre- quently, the only feasible means of monitoring changes in population size is to use counts of animals obtained by skilled observers as indices to abundance. Analysis of changes in population size can be severely biased if factors related to the acquisition of data are not adequately controlled for. In particular, we identify two types of observer effects: these correspond to baseline differences in observer competence and to changes through time in the ability of individual observers. We present a family of models for count data in which the first of these observer effects is treated as a nui- sance parameter. Conditioning on totals of negative binomial counts yields a Dirichlet compound multinomial vector for each observer. Quasi-likelihood is used to estimate parameters related to population trajectory and other parameters of interest; model selection is carried out on the basis of Akaike's information criterion. An example is presented using data on Wood thrush from the North American Breeding Bird Survey},

abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spatial synchrony refers to coincident changes in the abundance or other time-varying characteristics of geographically disjunct populations. This phenomenon has been documented in the dynamics of species representing a variety of taxa and ecological roles. Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms: (a) dispersal among populations, reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall, a phenomenon known as the "Moran effect"; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony, there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species, the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify. Furthermore, some popula- tions may exhibit complex spatial dynamics such as spiral waves and chaos. Statistical tests based on phase coherence and/or time-lagged spatial correlation are required to characterize these more complex patterns of spatial dynamics fully.},

Although the underlying mechanisms remain debated, theory holds that both density-dependent and density-independent processes shape the dynamics. One striking example is the large-scale fluctuations of sardine and anchovy observed across the major upwelling areas of the world. Despite a long history of research, the causes of these fluctuations remain unresolved and heavily debated, with significant implications for fisheries management. We here model the underlying causes of these fluctuations, using the California Current Ecosystem as a case study, and show that the dynamics, accurately reproduced since A.D. 1661 onward, are explained by interacting density-dependent processes (i.e., through species-specific life-history traits) and climate forcing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fishing modifies the dynamics and show that the sardine collapse of the 1950s was largely unavoidable given poor recruitment conditions. Our approach provides unique insight into the origin of sardine-anchovy fluctuations and a knowledge base for sustainable fisheries management in the California Current Ecosystem and beyond.},

In this study, stable isotope ratios (d 15 N and d 13 C) were used to quantify trophic relationships and food chain length (measured as a continuous variable) in 14 Ontario and Quebec lakes. All lakes con-tained lake trout as the top predator, although lakes differed in the presumed number of trophic levels leading to this species. The pre-sumed number of trophic levels was correlated with food chain length and explained 40% of the among-lake variation. Food chain length was most closely related to fish species richness () and lake 2 r = 0.69 area (). However, the two largest study lakes had shorter 2 r = 0.50 food chains than lakes of intermediate size and species richness, producing hump-shaped relationships with food chain length. Lake productivity was not a powerful predictor of food chain length (), and we argue that productive space (productivity mul-2 r = 0.36 tiplied by area) is a more accurate measure of available energy. This study addresses the need for improved food web descriptions that incorporate information about energy flow and the relative impor-tance of trophic pathways.

Moreover, how ecosystem collapse manifests itself will be ecosystem specific, as will be the associated mitigation strategies. In light of these challenges, we present a checklist of 11 practical principles to help managers reduce the risk of ecosystem collapse. These principles include developing a robust definition of collapse that is appropriate for a given ecosystem, managing for multiple ecosystem stressors under increasing uncertainty, adopting conservative approaches to management that account for potential losses of timber resources and limit the risk of overharvesting, and conducting long-term monitoring to gather data on key ecosystem attributes sensitive to ecological change.},

We hypothesized that apparent survival rate of juvenile males would show the greatest spatial and temporal variation as younger animals are more susceptible to extrinsic environmental factors, survival of yearling males would vary over space because of documented spatial variation in dispersal patterns, and survival of adults would be less variable than that of juveniles or yearlings and would vary over space because of demonstrated spatial variation in site quality. Our results revealed that, as predicted, the survival of juveniles varied over time and among sites, whereas that of yearlings varied among sites but not over time. The survival of adults did not vary significantly over time or among sites. We also examined the effects of several intrinsic and extrinsic environmental factors on spatial and temporal variation in survival rates. Our results suggest that male marmots of different ages respond differentially to temporal and spatial variation in environmental factors.},

To help advance its utility, we present a framework that focuses on linkages among different disciplines that are often used in studies of coupled human-natural systems, including the ecological, physical, and socioeco nomic sciences. The framework consists of three dimensions of complexity: spatial, organizational, and temporal. Spatial complexity increases as the focus changes from the type and number of the elements of spatial heterogeneity to an explicit configuration of the elements. Similarly, organizational complexity increases as the focus shifts from unconnected units to connectivity among functional units. Finally, temporal com plexity increases as the current state of a system comes to rely more and more on past states, and therefore to reflect echoes, legacies, and evolving indirect effects of those states.

abstract = {Effective fisheries management requires accurate estimates of stock biomass and trends; yet, assumptions in stock assessment models generate high levels of uncertainty and error. For 230 fisheries worldwide, we contrasted stock biomass estimates at the time of assessment with updated hindcast estimates modeled for the same year in later assessments to evaluate systematic over- or underestimation. For stocks that were overfished, low value, or located in regions with rising temperatures, historical biomass estimates were generally overstated compared with updated assessments. Moreover, rising trends reported for overfished stocks were often inaccurate. With consideration of bias identified retrospectively, 85\% more stocks than currently recognized have likely collapsed below 10\% of maximum historical biomass. The high uncertainty and bias in modeled stock estimates warrants much greater precaution by managers.
, 
Editor's summary

Assessment of the status of fisheries stocks is a key component of their management. Although there has been much debate around how to do fishery assessments, there has been a general belief that estimates are roughly accurate. Edgar
et al
. used publicly available data on 230 of the best-known fisheries species to test whether stock biomass estimates made in the year of the estimate were as accurate as specifically calculated hindcast models (see the Perspective by Froese and Pauly). They found that, especially in overfished species, historical estimates were higher than later estimates, indicating the presence of excessively positive assessments of stock status. —Sacha Vignieri},

A network of 14 of the 27 stations had (near) continuous data sets. These stations were clustered previously into exposed (northern/outer) and sheltered (southern/inner) sites. SST trends, evaluated between 1973 and 2010, show that the temperature contrast between these clusters is becoming greater: The northern/exposed stations are strongly influenced by interdecadal (Pacific Decadal oscillation [PDO]) and multidecadal oscillations in the north Pacific that are coherent with HadISST1.1 data for the region. There is no statistically significant warming trend for this region. The stations in the Strait of Georgia are much less influenced by the PDO and show a statistically significant mean increase in SST of up to 0.568C/decade (Anomaly 1). This is higher than the global average and contrasts markedly with the trends from the northern stations. The warming trends of the southern stations are significant at all months of the year but are most evident during summer (July-September). The summertime anomalies in temperature at Active Pass are significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with the temperature of the Fraser River water. Temperature differences between the Strait of Georgia and the outer shelf (Anomaly 2) are increasing in time; this is particularly evident since 2000. Monthly averaged MODIS satellite data (4×4-km resolution) show that trends in SST at two selected sites in the Strait of Georgia are very similar to the BC Lighthouse measurements and support the spatial extrapolation of the Lighthouse measurements. At present rates of SST rise, the southern coastal waters of BC will be about 38C warmer by the end of the 21st century.},

Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations (mean +/- standard error) at the beginning of exposures were as follows: control, 0.2 +/- 0.1 microg/L; low, 9.6 +/- 2.5 microg/L; medium, 40.7 +/- 6.9 microg/L; and high, 120.2 +/- 11.4 microg/L. Biological availability of hydrocarbons was confirmed by a significant induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 content and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity. Critical swimming speed (Ucrit) was significantly reduced in fish exposed to the highest concentration of WSF for 96 h (11% +/- 3.7% reduction) and at the two highest concentrations at four weeks (16% +/- 3.6% and 29% +/- 5.4% reductions) and eight weeks (11% +/- 3.8% and 40% +/- 5.7% reductions). Mortality occurred in all groups 24 h following Ucrit swim trials, with significantly higher mortalities observed in fish exposed to WSF in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (maximum mortality of 72.2% +/- 5.5% in the eight-week, high-exposure group). Burst swimming alone resulted in increased plasma cortisol, lactate, Na+, and Cl- concentrations and decreased muscle glycogen levels that returned to baseline values by 24 h. An interpretation of the effect of WSF exposure on postexercise metabolic recovery was complicated by pre-exercise alterations in several parameters. The time courses and magnitudes of several key postexercise parameters, including plasma cortisol, lactate, and muscle glycogen, were significantly altered by exposure to WSE The present study clearly shows that hydrocarbon exposure can reduce the swimming ability of fish and their ability to recover from exhaustive exercise.},

abstract = {We compared the resistance to whirling disease of two groups of Colorado River rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and a domestic strain of rainbow trout in a controlled laboratory challenge. These three groups represented the progeny of wild rainbow trout known to have recruited (1) during the early years of infestation by Myxobolus cerebralis of the Colorado River or (2) before the presence of M. cerebralis in the system and (3) the Erwin strain of rainbow trout. The severity of whirling disease in each group was dependent on the dose of triactinomyxons of M. cerebralis to which the fish were exposed. Microscopic lesions and spore counts both increased with increasing parasite dose. Survival of the progeny of Colorado fish that recruited before the presence of M. cerebralis in the system was significantly less than was that of the domestic fish exposed to 0 and 1,000 triactinomyxons/fish. The parents that recruited to the system before the presence of M. cerebralis were considerably older than were those used for our domestic strain; this difference in parent age probably resulted in the difference in survival because egg quality decreases with age in rainbow trout. There was no difference in microscopic lesions, spore counts, or swimming performance among the three groups of rainbow trout when exposed at the same parasite level, indicating that there was no difference in resistance to whirling disease among these groups of fish},

abstract = {Coastal British Columbia is largely a rugged fjord-land archipelago. It has not always been so – over time, the coastline has changed configuration dramatically and the fauna and flora have seen multiple successions and extirpations. Through this, for the last 11,000 RCYBP years at least, resilient people made their living from the ocean and the land, shrugging off or taking advantage of environmental change. Similarly, archaeologists have worked the nooks and crannies of the coast for decades, surveying in the dense forest and digging in the deep middens, subject to similar environmental conditions as those they study and making quiet progress in regional culture histories. In more recent years, this area has been thrust to the forefront of research into the First Peopling of the American continents. As the Clovis First model began to be questioned, alternate modes and routes for the arrival of humans were brought in from the sidelines, including the hypothesized west coast route (e.g. Fladmark 1979). Not much research had been focused on this route, perhaps as Easton (1992) suggests, because of the terrestrial mindset of many archaeologists. Perhaps also, the prospects of finding sites on the deeply drowned landscapes or in the rugged, heavily forested hinterland was prohibitively daunting and led to a pessimistic outlook on success.},

abstract = {A mechanistic temperature-dependent model for preemergent growth coupled with spawning and river temperature data is used to evaluate early life history strategies for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Methow River, Washington, U.S.A. Since the model provides a predictable coupling between time of spawning and fry emergence, it helps explain the spatial and temporal patterns observed for the sympatric stocks. The model suggests that progeny of August-spawning chinook in upper river habitats emerge at button-up (no visible yolk sac) over a wide range of days in the early spring. The eggs grow efficiently, which maximizes fry mass. The progeny of October-spawning downstream chinook can exploit a wide range of habitats in the river because their emergence mass is not sensitive to location in the river, but the adults must spawn later in the season to avoid summer high temperatures. Late spawning forces fry to emerge prior to button-up to avoid scouring flows but synchronizes their emergence times. The trade-offs between the spawning strategies of these two salmon runs are complex and the seasonal and spatial distribution of temperatures plays a critical role in these trade-offs.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {Two views dealing with fish welfare in recreational fishing are discussed in an effort to stimulate the current discourse on the topic. The pragmatic approach asks whether and how strongly recreational fishing compromises the health and fitness of individual fishes and what can be done to avoid or mitigate such effects. Its implementation rests on accepting recreational fishing as a principally legitimate activity. The second approach to fish welfare focuses on suffering and pain in fishes and is usually morally prescriptive. Its central tenet is that some or all recreational fishing practices may be unacceptable unless sufficient benefits to humans are created, which justify the supposedly cruel treatment of the fishes. The pragmatic approach to fish welfare is preferred because it relies on objectively measurable variables of impaired fish welfare (e.g. physiological, behavioural or fitness indicators) and does not question recreational fishing on moral grounds. Contrary to a suffering-centred approach to fish welfare, a pragmatic perspective emphasizes positive messages and facilitates constructive dialogue among stakeholders. In contrast, a suffering-centred approach to fish welfare tends to promote tension and enduring conflict that cannot be reconciled objectively and thus should be avoided.},

This is common in the oceans, where spatial scales of management can be mismatched with spatially dynamic metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in metapopulations of an important forage fish by combining empirical analysis, numerical modeling and novel theory. We show that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however ignoring complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of cryptic collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management can help avoid cryptic collapses and the ensuing ecological, social and economic consequences.},

abstract = {Hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle] became established in the Atchafalaya River Basin (ARB) in south central Louisiana during the 1970s, and now dominates the submergent macrophyte community. We examined the potential effects of this shift in macrophyte composition on the distribution of phytomacrofauna by comparing water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in canopy and sub-canopy habitats at edge and interior locations within hydrilla and native coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) beds during the latter stages of the 2001 flood pulse. Both plant species exhibited similar water quality characteristics during the study, with significantly higher temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH levels in canopy habitats. Principal components analysis of log-transformed macroinvertebrate densities identified four assemblages that together accounted for 63.5% of the variation in the density data. The Gastropoda-Hydrachnida assemblage exhibited higher densities in coontail during May-June (declining river stages), and was more abundant at interior locations in both macrophyte beds during July (stable river stages). The Hemiptera-Amphipoda assemblage exhibited higher densities in the canopies of the two plants during both sampling periods, as did the Decapoda-Odonata assemblage in July. The Diptera-Coleoptera assemblage showed a similar trend in vertical distributions as well as marginally higher densities in hydrilla beds. The continued spread of hydrilla throughout the ARB has reduced the diversity of macrophyte habitats available to phytophilous macroinvertebrates, and has resulted in pervasive hypoxia in the macrophyte sub-canopy over large portions of available littoral habitat, with significant impacts on the vertical distribution of littoral macroinvertebrates},

For the Central Coast of Canada's Northern Shelf Bioregion, where an MPA network is being developed, we identified hotspots for structural corals and large-bodied sponges, which are foundation species vulnerable to bottom contact fisheries, and for Sebastidae, a fish family which includes species that are long-lived (> 100 years), overexploited, evolutionary distinctive, and at high trophic levels. Using 11 years of survey data that spanned from inland fjords to oceanic waters, we derived hotspot indices that accounted for species characteristics and abundances and examined hotspot distribution across depths and oceanographic subregions. The results highlight previously undocumented hotspot distributions, thereby informing the placement of MPAs for which high levels of protection are warranted. Given the vulnerability of the taxa that we examined to cumulative fishery impacts, prospective MPAs derived from our data should be considered for interim protection measures during the protracted period between final network design and the enactment of MPA legislations. These recommendations reflect our scientific data, which are only one way of understanding the seascape. Our surveys did not cover many locations known to Indigenous peoples as biologically important. Consequently, Indigenous knowledge should also contribute substantially to the design of the MPA network.},

abstract = {The practice of catch and release (CR) as a fisheries management tool to reduce fishing mortality is widely applied in both freshwater and marine fisheries, whether from shifts in angler attitudes related to harvest or from the increasing use of harvest restrictions such as closed seasons or length limits. This approach assumes that for CR fishing policies to benefit the stock, CR will result in much lower mortality than would otherwise occur. There are many challenges in the design of CR studies to assess mortality, and in many practical settings it is difficult to obtain accurate and precise estimates. The focus of this article is on the design and quantitative aspects of estimating CR mortality, the need for a comprehensive approach that explicitly states all components of CR mortality, and the assumptions behind these methods. A general conceptual model for CR mortality that is applicable to containment and tagging-based studies with a slight modification is presented. This article reviews the design and analysis of containment and tagging studies to estimate CR mortality over both the short and long term and then compares these two approaches. Additionally, the potential population-level impacts of CR mortality are discussed. A recurring theme is the difficulty of designing studies to estimate CR mortality com- prehensively and the need for additional research into both statistical model development and field study design.},

abstract = {Demography can have a significant effect on reproductive timing and the magnitude of such an effect can be comparable to environmentally induced variability. This effect arises because the individuals of many fish species spawn progressively earlier within a season and may produce more egg batches over a longer period as they get older, thus extending their lifetime spawning duration. Inter-annual variation in spawning time is a critical factor in reproductive success because it affects the early environmental conditions experienced by progeny and the period they have to complete phases of development. By reducing the average lifetime spawning duration within a fish stock, fishing pressure could be increasing the variability in reproductive success and reducing long-term stock reproductive potential. Empirical estimates of selection on birth date, from experiments and using otolith microstructure, demonstrate that there is considerable variation in selection on birth date both within a spawning season and between years. The few multi-year studies that have linked egg production with the survival of progeny to the juvenile stage further highlight the uncertainty that adults face in timing their spawning to optimize offspring survival. The production of many small batches of eggs over a long period of time within a season and over a lifetime is therefore likely to decrease variance and increase mean progeny survival. Quantifying this effect of demography on variability in survival requires a focus on lifetime reproductive success rather than year specific relationships between recruitment and stock reproductive potential. Modelling approaches are suggested that can better quantify the likely impact of changing spawning times on year-class strength and lifetime reproductive potential. The evidence presented strengthens the need to avoid fishing severely age truncated fish stocks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {For nearly a century, biologists have emphasized the profound importance of spatial scale for ecology, evolution and conservation. Nonetheless, objectively identifying critical scales has proven incredibly challenging. Here we extend new techniques from physics and social sciences that estimate modularity on networks to identify critical scales for movement and gene flow in animals. Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale. We argue that network modularity reveals critical meso-scales that are probably common in populations, providing a powerful means of identifying fundamental scales for biology and for conservation strategies aimed at recovering imperilled species.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that the evolution of an ecologically important character, the host associations of specialized phytophagous insects, has been influenced by limitations on genetic variation. Using as a historical framework a phylogenetic reconstruction of the history of host associations in the beetle genus Ophraella (Chrysomelidae), we have employed quantitative-genetic methods to screen four species for genetic variation in larval survival, oviposition (in one species only), and feeding responses to their congeners' host plants, in the Asteraceae. We here report results of studies of one species and evaluate the results from all four. Analysis of half-sib/full-sib families and of progenies of wild females of O. notulata, a specialist on Iva (Ambrosiinae), provided evidence of genetic variation in larval consumption of five of six test plants and in adult consumption of four of six. Larval mortality was complete on five plants; only on Ambrosia, a close relative of the natural host, was there appreciable, and genetically variable, survival. Oviposition on Ambrosia showed marginally significant evidence of genetic variation; a more distantly related plant elicited no oviposition at all. In compiling results from four Ophraella species, reported in this and two other papers, we found no evidence of genetic variation in 18 of 39 tests of feeding responses and 14 of 16 tests of larval survival on congeners' hosts. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that absence or paucity of genetic variation may constrain or at least bias the evolution of host associations. The lower incidence of genetic variation in survival than in feeding behavior may imply, according to recent models, that avoidance is a more common evolutionary response to novel plants than adaptation. The usually great disparity between mean performance on congeners' hosts and the species' natural hosts, and an almost complete lack of evidence for negative genetic correlations, argue against the likelihood that speciation has occurred by sympatric host shift. The presence versus apparent absence of genetic variation in consumption was correlated with the propinquity of relationship between the beetle species tested and the species that normally feeds on the test plant, suggesting that the history of host shifts in Ophraella has been guided in part by restrictions on genetic variation. It was also correlated with the propinquity of relationship between a test plant and the beetle's natural host. The contributions of plant relationships and insect relationships, themselves correlated in part, to the pattern of genetic variation, are not readily distinguishable, but together accord with phylogenetic evidence that these and other phytophagous insects adapt most readily to related plants. In this instance, therefore, the macroevolution of an ecologically important character appears to have been influenced by genetic constraints. We hypothesize that absence of the structural prerequisites for genetic variation in complex characters may affect genetic variation and the trajectory of evolution.},

abstract = {The common practice among researchers who study fish growth is to a priori adopt the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), which is the most used and ubiquitous equation in the fisheries literature. However, in many cases VBGM is not supported by the data and many species seem to follow different growth trajectories. The information theory approach frees the researcher from the limiting concept that a `true' growth model exists. Multi-model inference (MMI) based on information theory is proposed as a more robust alternative to study fish growth. The proposed methodology was applied to 133 sets of length-at-age data. Four candidate models were fitted to each data set: von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), Gompertz model, Logistic and the Power model; the three former assume asymptotic and the latter non-asymptotic growth. In each case, the `best' model was selected by minimizing the small-sample, bias-corrected form of the Akaike information criterion (AIC(c)). To quantify the plausibility of each model, the `Akaike weight' w(i) of each model was calculated. Following a MMI approach, the model averaged asymptotic length (L) over bar (infinity) for each case was estimated, by model averaging estimations of L-infinity interpreting Akaike weights as a posterior probability distribution over the set of candidate models. The VBGM was not selected as the best model in 65.4% of the cases. Most often VBGM was either strongly supported by the data (with no other substantially supported model) or had very low or no support by the data. The estimation of asymptotic length was greatly model dependent; L-infinity as estimated by VBGM was in every case greater than that estimated by the Gompertz model, which in turn was always greater than that estimated by the Logistic model. The percentage underestimation of the standard error of L-infinity, when ignoring model selection uncertainty, was on average 18% with values as high as 91%. Ignoring model selection uncertainty may have serious implications, e.g. when comparing the growth parameters of different fish populations. Multi-model inference by model averaging, based on Akaike weights, is recommended as a simple and easy to implement method to model fish growth, for making robust parameter estimations and dealing with model selection uncertainty.},

abstract = {An ecosystem approach to forage fish management is required because forage fish support large fisheries, are prey for many valued species in marine food webs, and provide important social and cultural benefits to humans. Complex ecosystem models are often used to evaluate potential ecosystem consequences of forage fish fisheries, but there is seldom sufficient data to parameterize them, and full consideration of uncertainty is impossible. Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE) provide a link between full ecosystem models and tactical (usually single-species) models typically used in fisheries management. MICE are ideal tools to form the basis for management strategy evaluations that compare the ability of candidate strategies to achieve goals related to target fisheries and broader ecosystem protection objectives. A MICE model is developed for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) that focuses on the fishery for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sajax) and the indirect impacts of the fishery on place-based predators, in particular brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), in the Southern California Bight. The model includes three forage species (sardine, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and ‘other forage'), an ‘other prey' category, and two predator species (brown pelican and California sea lion) and evaluates the impacts of variable forage availability on adult predator reproductive success and survival. Parameterization of the model is based on available monitoring data and assessment outputs. The model is used to assess the ecosystem and fishery consequences of the current sardine management systems for Mexico, the USA, and Canada, with a focus on identifying which among a long list of sources of uncertainty in the system are most consequential for predictions of fishery impacts on predators. Key sources of uncertainty to consider in ecosystem assessments for the CCE are how prey abundance and availability impact predator demography and the extent to which the dynamics of prey populations are driven by environmental factors. Data are available for some of these sources of uncertainty for CCE sardine management, but much uncertainty remains, necessitating exploration of sensitivity to alternative model formulations and parameter values when providing advice on management strategies to decision makers.},

abstract = {In western North America, normative trout invasions threaten the persistence of native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii subspp. through competition, predation, and hybridization. While small-scale individual-level studies on normative-native fish interactions have helped elucidate mechanisms of impact, very few investigations have occurred at a scale consistent with that of species replacement. Thus, large-scale population-level studies are needed to understand the effects of normative fish as well as to more effectively conserve native fishes in the presence of normative fish. For this reason, we conducted an evaluation of the effects of normative brown trout Salmo trutta on the individual- and population-level performance of native cutthroat trout using a field-experimental approach. We studied local populations of cutthroat trout in the presence and absence of brown trout in long stream reaches and subsequently compared growth, condition, stable-isotope-based measures of dietary habits, movement, and survival between treatment groups. We found clear evidence for reduced cutthroat trout growth owing to the presence of brown trout. Additionally, we observed differences in cutthroat trout dietary habits based on delta C-13 signatures resulting from our experimental manipulation of brown trout abundance. Finally, brown trout suppressed cutthroat trout movement but had no apparent effect on their survival. Considering previous studies, we concluded that the individual-level effects of brown trout on cutthroat trout are scale invariant. Higher-level impacts (i.e., on movement and survival), in contrast, appear to be more sensitive to the scale at which the investigation is conducted. Overall, our results indicate that brown trout can have strong negative effects on cutthroat trout performance and should therefore be more explicitly considered in native fish conservation plans.},

abstract = {Abstract Recreational fisheries are traditionally managed at local scales, but more effective management could be achieved using a cross?scale approach. To do this, we must first understand how local processes scale up to influence landscape patterns between anglers and resources. We highlight how population?based synchrony methods, used in conjunction with a complex?adaptive?systems framework, can reveal emergent spatial properties within social?ecological systems such as recreational fisheries. Herein, we quantified the level of spatial synchrony in angler behaviour, defined the relationship between angler synchrony and distance among waterbodies, and highlighted social?ecological attributes contributing to these patterns. We leveraged a 111 waterbody?year (34 waterbodies, 5?year collection period) recreational fisheries dataset from Nebraska, USA to address these objectives. Intra?annual patterns in angler behaviour were moderately synchronous across large spatial scales and predominately unrelated to distance among waterbodies. Large?scale synchronous patterns in angler behaviour emerged from local?scale interactions between angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity. Spatial synchrony in angler behaviour is an emergent property that resulted from local?level processes that scaled up to form large?scale patterns. We posit that angler utility in combination with waterbodies sharing these desired utility components caused spatial synchrony among anglers with similar preferences or specializations. The level of spatial synchrony in angler behaviour will therefore depend on the degree of angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity on the landscape, with high or low levels of both leading to low and high levels of spatial synchrony respectively. Synthesis and applications. Synchrony?based methods proved useful for unveiling an emergent property in recreational fisheries that is beneficial for effective cross?scale management. It may not be appropriate to extrapolate information and apply uniform management actions among local waterbodies because angler behaviour was not synchronous at small scales. Rather, anglers respond uniquely to waterbody diversity and therefore substitute waterbodies may be dispersed throughout the landscape. Creating boat access, for example could yield unintended consequences for a particular angler group and cause local and regional shifts in angler behaviour. Evaluating appropriate management options will require a cross?scale monitoring approach that captures angler heterogeneity and waterbody diversity at multiple scales.},

abstract = {Mass migrations are among the most striking examples of animal movement in the natural world. Such migrations are major drivers of ecosystem processes and strongly influence the survival and fecundity of individuals. For migratory animals, a formidable challenge is to find their way over long distances and through complex, dynamic environments. However, recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that by traveling in groups, individuals are able to overcome these challenges and increase their ability to navigate. Here we use models to explore the implications of collective navigation on migratory, and population, dynamics, for both breeding migrations (to-and-fro migrations between distinct, fixed, end-points) and feeding migrations (loop migrations that track favorable conditions). We show that while collective navigation does improve a population's ability to migrate accurately, it can lead to Allee effects, causing the sudden collapse of populations if numbers fall below a critical threshold. In some scenarios, hysteresis prevents the migration from recovering even after the cause of the collapse has been removed. In collectively navigating populations that are locally adapted to specific breeding sites, a slight increase in mortality can cause a collapse of genetic population structure, rather than population size, making it more difficult to detect and prevent. Despite the large interest in collective behavior and its ubiquity in many migratory species, there is a notable lack of studies considering the implications of social navigation on the ecological dynamics of migratory species. Here we highlight the potential for a previously overlooked Allee effect in socially migrating species that may be important for conservation and management of such species.},

abstract = {<p>Temporal trends in productivity of Pacific salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.) stocks are important to detect in a timely and reliable manner to permit appropriate management responses. However, detecting such trends is difficult because observation error and natural variability in survival rates tend to obscure underlying trends. A Kalman filter estimation procedure has previously been shown to be effective in such situations. We used it on a Ricker spawner–recruit model to reconstruct indices of annual productivity (recruits per spawner (R/S) at low spawner abundance) based on historical data for 120 stocks of pink ( Oncorhynchus gorbuscha ), chum ( Oncorhynchus keta ), and sockeye ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) salmon. These stocks were from Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. The resulting estimated temporal trends in productivity show large changes (on average 60%–70% differences in R/S and average ratios of highest to lowest R/S between 5.4 and 7.9 for the three species). Such changes suggest that salmon stock assessment methods should take into account possible nonstationarity. This step will help provide scientific advice to help managers to meet conservation and management objectives. The Kalman filter results also identified some stocks that did not share temporal trends with other stocks; these exceptions may require special monitoring and management efforts.</p>},

abstract = {While there is great interest in the degree to which local interactions "scale-up" to predict regional patterns of abundance, few studies in marine systems have simultaneously examined patterns of abundance at both the large scale (tens of kilometers) typical of larval movement and the small scale (meters) typical of post-settlement interactions. We addressed this gap by monitoring larval supply, adult survivorship, and giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera, a primary habitat-forming species) abundance for 13 populations of kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) spread over approximately 200 km in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. At the small, within-site scale, both recruitment and adult survivorship of kelp bass were density-dependent and positively related to kelp abundance. At the larger, among-site scale, the spatial pattern of adult kelp bass abundance was predicted well by the pattern of kelp bass larval supply, but there was a consistent negative spatial relationship between kelp abundance and kelp bass larval supply despite the positive effects of kelp on kelp bass at the smaller spatial scale. This large-scale negative relationship was likely a product of a channel-wide spatial mismatch between oceanographic conditions that favor kelp survival and those that concentrate and distribute fish larvae. These results generally support the recruit-adult hypothesis: kelp bass populations are limited by recruitment at low recruit densities but by density-dependent competition for food resources and/or predator refuges at high recruit densities. At the same time, spatial variation in kelp abundance produced substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in kelp bass demographics, which argues for a multispecies, metacommunity approach to predicting kelp bass dynamics.},

abstract = {Abstract Marine protected areas (MPAs) have grown exponentially, emerging as a widespread tool to conserve biodiversity and enhance fisheries production. Although numerous empirical studies and global syntheses have evaluated the effects of MPAs on community structure (e.g., biodiversity), no broad assessment concerning their capacity to influence ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) exists. Here, we present meta-analyses that compare rates of predation and herbivory on a combined 32 species across 30 MPAs spanning 85° of latitude. Our analyses synthesize the fate of 15,225 field experiment assays, and demonstrate that MPAs greatly increased predation intensity on animals but not herbivory on macroalgae or seagrass. Predation risk, quantified as the odds of prey being eaten, was largely determined by predator abundance and biomass within reserves. At MPAs with the greatest predator accumulation, the odds of predation increased to nearly 49:1, as opposed to 1:1 at MPAs where predators actually declined. Surprisingly, we also found evidence that predation risk declined with increased sea-surface temperature. Greater predation risk within MPAs was consistent with predator and prey population abundance estimates, where predators increased 4.4-fold within MPAs, whereas prey decreased 2.2-fold. For herbivory, the lack of change may have been driven by functional redundancy and the inability of reserves to increase herbivore abundance relative to fished zones in our sample. Overall, this work highlights the capacity of MPAs to restore a critical ecosystem function such as predation, which mediates energy flows and community assembly within natural systems. However, our review of the literature also uncovers relatively few studies that have quantified the effects of MPAs on ecosystem function, highlighting a key gap in our understanding of how protected areas may alter ecological processes and deliver ecosystem services. From a historical perspective, these findings suggest that modern levels of predation in the coastal oceans may currently only be a fraction of the baseline prior to human exploitation.},

abstract = {The nature and impact of fishing on predators that share a fished resource is an important consideration in ecosystem-based fisheries management. Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill-predator fishery dynamics to help advise on allocation of the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce the potential impact of fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e.g., a different spatial distribution of catches). The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies. Results of the model have been considered in recent management deliberations for spatial allocations of krill catches in the Scotia Sea and their associated impacts on dependent predator species. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Although climate-induced shifts in fish distribution have been widely reported at the population level, studies that account for ontogenetic shifts and subregional differences when assessing responses are rare.In this study, groundfish distributional changes in depth, latitude, and longitude were assessed at different size classes by species within nine subregions. We examined large, quality-controlled datasets of depth-stratified-random bottom trawl surveys conducted during summer in three large regions—the Gulf of Alaska and the west coasts of Canada and the United States—over the period 1996–2015, a time period punctuated by a marine “heat wave.” Temporal biases in bottom temperature were minimized by subdividing each region into three subregions, each with short-duration surveys. Near-bottom temperatures, weighted by stratum area, were unsynchronized across subregions and exhibited varying subregional interannual variability. The weighted mean bottom depths in the subregions also vary largely among subregions. The centroids (centers of gravity) of groundfish distribution were weighted with catch per unit effort and stratum area for 10 commercially important groundfish species by size class and subregion. Our multivariate analyses showed that there were significant differences in aggregate fish movement responses to warm temperatures across subregions but not among species or sizes. Groundfish demonstrated poleward responses to warming temperatures only in a few subregions and moved shallower or deeper to seek colder waters. The temperature responses of groundfish depended on where they were. Under global warming, groundfish may form geographically distinct thermal ecoregions along the northeast Pacific shelf. Shallow-depth species exhibited greatly different distributional responses to temperature changes across subregions while deep-depth species of different subregions tend to have relatively similar temperature responses. Future climate studies would benefit by considering fish distributions on small subregional scales.},

abstract = {Abstract




Low trophic‐level forage fish are experiencing global declines, influencing coupled human–ocean systems worldwide. Along the northwest coast of North America, declining trajectories of Pacific herring (

Clupea pallasii

) have prompted interest in improving the understanding of its population and community dynamics to better guide future conservation and management strategies.



To improve future population estimates and understanding of the ecological factors governing herring egg survival, the magnitude, spatial variation and mechanisms driving herring egg loss rates were quantified. This was achieved by way of repeated observational field surveys and a predator exclusion experiment.


Observational surveys revealed that regional egg loss rates (Z) were substantial and ranged from 0.101 ± 0.019 to 0.134 ± 0.028, the equivalent of 88–94\% egg loss over a 21 day incubation period, or 50–60\% egg loss over 6.8 days, the average time lag between spawn deposition and annual egg surveys. Furthermore, spatial variation was high, with egg loss rates varying 5‐fold among study sites. Depth, time since spawn, and spawn area were primary spatial drivers of egg loss, but predator abundance and exposure were secondarily important.


Experimental evidence showed that benthic predation and habitat type were strong drivers of egg loss, suggesting that a high proportion of eggs, particularly those spawned on benthic substrates, are consumed by predators.


These results have important conservation implications for managers and ecologists seeking to estimate herring biomass and to understand the environmental influences on predator–prey interactions that affect herring dynamics.},

abstract = {Abstract Fisheries exploitation can cause genetic changes in heritable traits of targeted stocks. The direction of selective pressure forced by harvest acts typically in reverse to natural selection and selects for explicit life histories, usually for younger and smaller spawners with deprived spawning potential. While the consequences that such selection might have on the population dynamics of a single species are well emphasized, we are just beginning to perceive the variety and severity of its propagating effects within the entire marine food webs and ecosystems. Here, we highlight the potential pathways in which fisheries-induced evolution, driven by size-selective fishing, might resonate through globally connected systems. We look at: (i) how a size truncation may induce shifts in ecological niches of harvested species, (ii) how a changed maturation schedule might affect the spawning potential and biomass flow, (iii) how changes in life histories can initiate trophic cascades, (iv) how the role of apex predators may be shifting and (v) whether fisheries-induced evolution could codrive species to depletion and biodiversity loss. Globally increasing effective fishing effort and the uncertain reversibility of eco-evolutionary change induced by fisheries necessitate further research, discussion and precautionary action considering the impacts of fisheries-induced evolution within marine food webs.},

The method is especially suited to sparse response data, as often occurs when fine-grained adverse events are collected from subjects in studies sized more for efficacy than for safety investigations. A combined analysis of data from multiple studies can be performed and the method enables a search for vulnerable subgroups based on the covariates in the regression model.

Fecundity-length relationships for many exploited fish stocks are often poorly understood due to small sample sizes and high levels of intrinsic variability among individuals. Several species in the genus Sebastes match this description, and are important components of commercial and recreational fisheries off the U.S. West Coast. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for simultaneous estimation of parameters in the fecundity-length relationships for 29 species of rockfish while accounting for variability within and among subgenera. Hierarchical models that account for subgeneric phylogenetic structure and variability among species outperformed models that treat all species in the genus as exchangeable or ignored variation among species within a subgenus, based on a predictive information criterion. Our results confirm that weight-specific fecundity increases with size in nearly all Sebastes species, and that the assumption of proportionality between mature female biomass and total egg production is inappropriate for most Sebastes stock assessments. Benefits of the hierarchical framework include prediction of fecundity-length parameters at the genus, subgenus, and species level, as well as predictive distributions for unobserved Sebastes species.},

At the level of the whole dataset, the piecewise linear-regression method was accurate and showed only a minor bias (22120{\textperiodcentered}17 years) relative to age at maturation visually read from scales. The method, however, was relatively imprecise and provided an estimate of age at maturation equal to the one read from the scale in less than half of the cases (47{\textperiodcentered}6%). Moreover, bias was strongly dependent on age at maturation: the age at maturation of early maturing fish was often overestimated, whereas the opposite was true for late-maturing fish. Accuracy and precision of the regression method relative to visual readings also depended on the growth type (determined by the nursery area of young C. harengus) and cohort but not on sex. Modifying the original regression method enabled marginally improving the precision of the approach but a strong maturation age-dependent bias persisted. The results with C. harengus suggested that age-at-maturation estimates from the piecewise linear regression method should be treated with caution.},

This study investigated the potential for using underwater video analysis (UWVA) as an alternative to electrofishing for assessing the diversity and relative abundance of imperilled fishes in clear, relatively shallow (<1.5 m) headwater streams. Detection rates using UWVA were higher than with electrofishing, relative abundance estimates between the two methods were significantly correlated, the attractive effect of the camera was negligible and UWVA was logistically feasible for sampling small headwater streams. These results have clear conservation implications as it was demonstrated that UWVA is a suitable sampling method for estimating relative abundance of fishes in small, clear headwater streams.

For both species, strays colonized immediately but decreased as a proportion of the total run over time. Chinook salmon strays were more numerous in years when the species was more abundant below the dam and included a much larger proportion of hatchery origin salmon than did coho salmon. Productivity, calculated as the ratio of female recruits sampled at the dam to female spawners, exceeded replacement in all four coho salmon cohorts but only two of five Chinook salmon cohorts, leading to more rapid population expansion of coho salmon. However, estimates of fishing mortality and recruitment into the Cedar River below the dam substantially increased Chinook salmon productivity estimates.

abstract = {Occasionally, surprisingly large shifts occur in ecosystems. Theory suggests that such shifts can be attributed to alternative stable states. Verifying this diagnosis is important because it implies a radically different view on management options, and on the potential effects of global change on such ecosystems. For instance, it implies that gradual changes in temperature or other factors might have little effect until a threshold is reached at which a large shift occurs that might be difficult to reverse. Strategies to assess whether alternative stable states are present are now converging in fields as disparate as desertification, limnology, oceanography and climatology. Here, we review emerging ways to link theory to observation, and conclude that although, field observations can provide hints of alternative stable states, experiments and models are essential for a good diagnosis.},

abstract = {Many coral reef fishes exhibit distinct ontogenetic shifts in habitat use while some species settle directly in adult habitats, but there is not any general explanation to account for these differences in settlement strategies among coral reef fishes. This study compared distribution patterns and habitat associations of juvenile (young of the year) butterflyfishes to those of adult conspecifics. Three species, Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon melannotus, and Chaetodon vagabundus, all of which have limited reliance on coral for food, exhibited marked differences in habitat association of juvenile versus adult individuals. Juveniles of these species were consistently found in shallow-water habitats, whereas adult conspecifics were widely distributed throughout a range of habitats. Juveniles of seven other species (Chaetodon aureofasciatus, Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon plebeius, Chaetodon rainfordi, and Chaetodon trifascialis), all of which feed predominantly on live corals, settled directly into habitat occupied by adult conspecifics. Butterflyfishes with strong reliance on corals appear to be constrained to settle in habitats that provide access to essential prey resources, precluding their use of distinct juvenile habitats. More generalist butterflyfishes, however, appear to utilize distinct juvenile habitats and exhibit marked differences in the distribution of juveniles versus adults.},

abstract = {Mangroves provide important habitats for many species throughout the tropics and subtropics. But the direct contribution of mangrove productivity to associated food webs through trophic interactions varies depending on site-specific context. We used stable isotopes to examine trophic structure among major habitat types associated with 2 fringing mangrove areas in Shark Bay, Western Australia, a nearly pristine ecosystem. The only mangrove species, Avicennia marina, had a distinctive {\^{I}}´13C isotopic value, which allowed direct testing of the hypothesis that consumers relied on mangrove-derived production. We found little evidence to support this hypothesis in isotope values of invertebrates or fish from 4 different feeding guilds. Within the species of fish we were able to sample, variation in {\^{I}}´13C and {\^{I}}´15N stable isotope values occurred over spatial scales of hundreds of meters. Some of this variation is consistent with the spatial mosaics of seagrass, sand flat and mangrove habitats available to fish. In a nearly pristine system, fish captured in mangrove systems show fine scale variability in stable isotope values, but we found no indication that mangrove productivity directly supported local fish populations through the trophic web. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

Regression models for abundance of adults of all species were significant. Regression models for miniature H. convergens, H. parenthesis, and C. septempunctata were significant,but regression models for immature C. plorabunda and N. americoferus were not significant. Regression parameters differed among the three fields for most predator species, indicating that the numerical response was dependent on geographical location. To obtain insight into why the numerical response by predators differed among fields we determined how the abundance of predators in alfalfa fields was influenced by the landscape surrounding a field and the vegetation in it. Variables describing the complexity of the landscape surrounding alfalfa fields and the plant community in the fields entered into regression models for predator abundance and explained a greater proportion of the variance in predator abundance than aphid abundance did. We conclude that the structure of the landscape matrix plays an important role in determining the abundance of aphid predators in alfalfa fields, as does the plant community in a field. These effects can sometimes overshadow the direct numerical response by predators to aphids.},

abstract = {Managers of the recreational fishery for walleyes Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum) in Alberta, Canada, face an unusual combination of very low productivity (related to the northern climate) and high fishing pressure. Passive management of the large recreational fishery and active management of the smaller commercial fishery failed to prevent declines and collapses of walleye stocks. During the 1990s, extensive consultations with the public resulted in the development of an active recreational fishery management system using set points to classify stocks. Catch and release and large, highly restrictive length limits were used to regulate the harvest. These restrictions on the recreational harvest resulted in a dramatic increase in the catch rates of growth-overfished stocks. Paradoxically, this recovery has created dilemmas and controversies in both the recreational and commercial fisheries. Anglers are now dissatisfied with the low harvest rates and absence of large fish attending the high catch rates of small fish. The total allowable catch, however, is being taken by hooking mortality and illegal harvest of undersize walleyes in the recreational harvest. In commercial gill-net fisheries for lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis, increasing bycatch of walleyes restricts the harvest of lake whitefish and has created uneconomical fisheries. Resolving these dilemmas will require dramatic changes to fisheries management techniques in Alberta.},

abstract = {A central and classic question in ecology is what causes populations to fluctuate in abundance. Understanding the interaction between natural drivers of fluctuating populations and human exploitation is an issue of paramount importance for conservation and natural resource management. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain fluctuations: (i) species interactions, such as predator-prey interactions, cause fluctuations, (ii) strongly nonlinear single-species dynamics cause fluctuations, and (iii) environmental variation cause fluctuations. We combine a general fisheries model with data from a global sample of fish species to assess how two of these hypothesis, nonlinear single-species dynamics and environmental variation, interact with human exploitation to affect the variability of fish populations. In contrast with recent analyses that suggest fishing drives increased fluctuations by changing intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, we show that singlespecies nonlinear dynamics alone, both in the presence and absence of fisheries, are unlikely to drive deterministic fluctuations in fish; nearly all fish populations fall into regions of stable dynamics. However, adding environmental variation dramatically alters the consequences of exploitation on the temporal variability of populations. In a variable environment, (i) the addition of mortality from fishing leads to increased temporal variability for all species examined, (ii) variability in recruitment rates of juveniles contributes substantially more to fluctuations than variation in adult mortality, and (iii) the correlation structure of juvenile and adult vital rates plays an important and underappreciated role in determining population fluctuations. Our results are robust to alternative model formulations and to a range of environmental autocorrelation.},

Some general lessons are drawn, primarily from the IWC's process of developing its Revised Management Procedure. Further implementation issues discussed are: candidate procedure selection in principle and practice, the extent of robustness testing desirable, the link to the evaluation of research priorities, and the reception accorded the management procedure approach by industry and decision-makers. Management procedures are seen to have potential benefits over the annual assessment basis for determination of Total Allowable Catch, but key problem areas that remain concern the definition of risk and the relative weights to be accorded to the various scenarios (of differing plausibilities) considered in robustness tests.

abstract = {This essay explores shifting scientific understandings of fish and the evolution of fisheries science, and it grapples with colonialism as a system of power. We trace the rise of fisheries science to a time when Western nation-states were industrializing fishing fleets and competing for access to distant fishing grounds. A theory of fishing called “maximum sustainable yield” (MSY) that understands fish species in aggregate was espoused. Although alternatives to MSY have been developed, decision-making continues to be informed by statistical models developed within fisheries science. A challenge for structured management systems now rests in attending to different systems of knowledge and addressing local objectives, values, and circumstances. To deepen and illustrate key points, we examine Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and the expansion of commercial herring fisheries and state-led management in British Columbia, Canada. A feedback between colonialism and fisheries science is evident: colonialism generated the initial conditions for expansion and has been reinforced through the implementation of approaches and tools from fisheries science that define and quantify conservation in particular ways. Some features may be unique to the herring illustration, but important aspects of the feedback are more broadly gener-alizable. We propose three interconnected goals: (a) transform the siloed institutions and practices of Western science, (b) reimagine and rebuild pathways between information (including diverse values and perspectives) and decision-making, and (c) devolve governance authority and broaden governance processes such that multiple ways of knowing share equal footing.},

abstract = {Increasingly, fisheries researchers and managers seek or are compelled to “bridge” Indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific approaches to understanding and governing fisheries. Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi'kmaw) embraces “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,” as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative—central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

In aquatic systems, which have much lower oxygen concentrations than the atmosphere, vascular aquatic plants can affect oxygen concentrations significantly not only on long time scales but also on time scales of less than a day. Aquatic plants are generally thought of as adding oxygen to aquatic systems through photosynthesis, but the impact of vascular aquatic plants on oxygen varies greatly with plant morphology. Floating-leaved plants that vent oxygen to the atmosphere can strongly deplete oxygen. In some ecosystems where floating-leaved plants have replaced submersed vegetation, oxygen concentrations have been substantially reduced.

abstract = {Paleontological and historical stock abundance estimates indicate that pelagic fish populations inhabiting upwelling ecosystems undergo large interdecadal variations in abundance with amplitudes equal to, if not larger than, the interannual variability. The interdecadal variability is characterized by periods of high and low abundance, termed "pseudo-cycles", because of their irregular periodicity. Fisheries targeting small pelagic fish suffer from overall overcapitalization, like many other fisheries, but also from an additional overcapitalization problem: a phase displacement between rapid fish population decreases and a slower disinvestment which follows. This lag produces economic hardship. Here we document the fish:fishery relationship for the Peruvian anchoveta. Anchoveta pseudo-cycles of 20 to >100 years are observed, with the present stock abundance most likely located near upper part of the cycle. Fleet overcapacity expressed as the proportion of unused present capacity is estimated at 72% and processing overcapacity at 89%. A simple bio-economic model demonstrates the risks associated with the pseudo-periodicity in fish stock abundance in conjunction with fishery investment, open access, and overcapacity: a timing bomb for the fishing sector. The lag between disinvestment and decrease in fish abundance is quantified. A reduction of the fishing and processing capacity and measures to decrease the investment lag are recommended to limit the social, economical and political tensions that will result from the expected decrease in stock abundance. Finally, some management options to reduce these risks are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Large portions of anadromous salmonid habitat in the western United States has been lost because of dams and other blockages. This loss has the potential to affect salmonid evolution through natural selection if the loss is biased, affecting certain types of habitat differentially, and if phenotypic traits correlated with those habitat types are heritable. Habitat loss can also affect salmonid evolution indirectly, by reducing genetic variation and changing its distribution within and among populations. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of lost habitats with currently accessible habitats and review the heritability of traits which show correlations with habitat/environmental gradients. We find that although there is some regional variation, inaccessible habitats tend to be higher in elevation, wetter and both warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than habitats currently available to anadromous salmonids. We present several case studies that demonstrate either a change in phenotypic or life history expression or an apparent reduction in genetic variation associated with habitat blockages. These results suggest that loss of habitat will alter evolutionary trajectories in salmonid populations and Evolutionarily Significant Units. Changes in both selective regime and standing genetic diversity might affect the ability of these taxa to respond to subsequent environmental perturbations. Both natural and anthropogenic and should be considered seriously in developing management and conservation strategies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 Elsevier Inc. Pipelines carrying diluted bitumen (dilbit) from Canada's oil sands traverse North America, including the freshwater habitat of Pacific salmon, posing a risk of environmental release and aquatic exposure. Swimming performance is impacted in juvenile sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) exposed to dilbit; therefore biomarkers of dilbit exposure will be valuable for monitoring at-risk salmon stocks. This study characterized changes in the serum proteome of sockeye exposed to a sub-lethal and environmentally relevant concentration of dilbit using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), and included a range of experimental conditions to permit identification of biomarkers that are robust across time (1 and 4 wk) and exercise level (at rest and following a swim test). Over 500 proteins were identified and quantified in sockeye serum, with dilbit exposure significantly altering the abundance of 24 proteins irrespective of time and exercise, including proteins associated with immune and inflammatory responses, coagulation, and iron homeostasis. An increase in creatine kinase (CK) activity in serum of dilbit-exposed salmon confirmed the higher CK protein abundance measured using iTRAQ. The combination of 4 wk dilbit exposure and a swim test had a greater effect on the serum proteome than either treatment alone, including a marked increase in tissue leakage proteins, suggesting that aerobic exercise exacerbates the serum proteome response to dilbit, and the increased cellular damage could impede exercise recovery. This study provides a foundation for the development of bio-monitoring tools for salmon stock assessments, and offers new insights into the sub-lethal toxicity of crude oil exposure in fish.},

abstract = {Accurate and efficient monitoring of habitat structure on rangelands is important for understanding wildlife responses to land management practices. Unfortunately, studies of wildlife responses to changes in habitat structure often use monitoring techniques that fail to measure variation in multiple structural dimensions. Our objectives were to evaluate relationships between measures of habitat structure in a shrubland community and to discuss the usefulness of several techniques in integrating multiple structural dimensions into a single index of habitat structure. We evaluated relationships between shrub cover, herbaceous cover, shrub patch number, average shrub patch size, average vegetation height, visual obstruction across multiple strata of a profile board, cone of vulnerability, and angle of obstruction using a principle component analysis. Many of these variables were redundant with each other. Average visual obstruction estimates, using a profile board, were associated with variability in vertical structure as indicated by its association with height. Coefficients of variation for cone of vulnerability and visual obstruction were dependent upon their means and of limited use in describing horizontal patchiness. In contrast, shrub patch number was not linearly correlated with any other single measure in our analysis, and may be useful in describing horizontal patchiness. Cone of vulnerability and angle of obstruction are recently developed techniques that provided useful, single indices of multidimensional habitat structure. Efficient monitoring of wildlife habitat structure should employ multiple, independent techniques that measure distinct dimensions of habitat structure or a single measure that integrates multiple dimensions. /// El monitoreo eficiente y certero de la estructura del h&#xe1;bitat es importante para entender la respuesta de la fauna silvestre a las pr&#xe1;cticas de manejo del terreno.

abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index.},

We show that the constraints imposed on life history variation by the character of the biphasic growth model are such that optimal life histories will exhibit associations among growth parameters, reproductive investment, and mortality that are largely consistent with associations evident in both our data set and earlier empirical studies; the von Bertalanffy growth parameter k varies with reproductive investment, and both k and investment vary with adult mortality. Our analysis suggests that within a food web, life history parameters will shift in a predictable fashion with the decreases in mortality expected as one moves from primary consumers up toward top predators. This expectation is supported by the differences in life history parameters that we observe between the two top predators in our data set (lake trout and walleye) and the two mid-trophic level consumers (cisco and yellow perch).},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is the state-of-the-art approach for testing and comparing management strategies in a way that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. monitoring, estimation, and implementation). Management strategy evaluation can help identify management strategies that are robust to uncertainty about the life history of the target species and its relationship to other species in the food web. Small pelagic fish (e.g. anchovy, herring and sardine) fulfil an important ecological role in marine food webs and present challenges to the use of MSE and other simulation-based evaluation approaches. This is due to considerable stochastic variation in their ecology and life history, which leads to substantial observation and process uncertainty. Here, we summarize the current state of MSE for small pelagic fishes worldwide. We leverage expert input from ecologists and modellers to draw attention to sources of process and observation uncertainty for small pelagic species, providing examples from geographical regions where these species are ecologically, economically and culturally important. Temporal variation in recruitment and other life-history rates, spatial structure and movement, and species interactions are key considerations for small pelagic fishes. We discuss tools for building these into the MSE process, with examples from existing fisheries. We argue that model complexity should be informed by management priorities and whether ecosystem information will be used to generate dynamics or to inform reference points. We recommend that our list of considerations be used in the initial phases of the MSE process for small pelagic fishes or to build complexity on existing single-species models.},

Some believe that pinnipeds are now preventing the recovery of certain fish populations, and that controlling pinniped population abundance using lethal measures such as harvesting or by non-lethal means like contraception could recover fish populations. It is unclear, however, how effective and how long it would take for such methods of population control to bring numbers of pinnipeds down to target levels. We used sex- and age-structured population models to estimate how quickly harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) abundance in British Columbia, Canada, could be reduced by 50%, through combinations of lethal removals and sterilization of adult females. Models were fit to seal abundance, demographic, and harvest data collected between 1879 and 2014. Simulation modeling suggests reliance on contraception exclusively is unlikely to reduce the current harbor seal population (numbering $\sim$100,000) by 50% within 25 years, and would result in more variable outcomes, compared to lethal removals. Contraception could be combined with harvesting to maintain a target abundance of harbor seals (although captive studies with harbor seals are needed to confirm the efficacy of contraception). Our simulation modeling approach provides a useful framework to assess how non-lethal measures could be integrated into policies that promote active population control of harbor seal numbers.},

abstract = {The Beverton–Holt and Ricker stock-recruit functions were derived in terms of two pre-recruit mortality parameters. Mace, & Doonan, (1988, A generalized bioeconomic simulation model for fish population dynamics) reparameterized the stock-recruit function in terms of steepness, which combines pre-recruit mortality with post-recruit biological parameters defining unfished spawning biomass per recruit. Their parameterization explicitly assumes a stable age distribution at unexploited conditions, but also implicitly assumes that unexploited spawning biomass per recruit is time invariant. Temporal variation could occur in either pre-recruit mortality rates or post-recruit biological parameters, but different dynamics are produced. The former results in variation in both the stock-recruit curve and the population equilibria, whereas variation in the latter only changes the points of equilibria on the curve. Thus, variation in either pre- or post-recruit parameters will result in variation in steepness, maximum sustainable yield and associated management reference points. Empirical measures of components of post-recruit productivity (maturity and mass at age, e.g.) are available for many managed fish stocks and often exhibit temporal variability. Yet use of the steepness parameterization requires an analyst to specify one set of post-recruit biological parameters to define unexploited spawning biomass per recruit for the full time series. This misspecification leads to misperception of biological reference points and has implications for meta-analyses of steepness, and interpretation of the dynamic (Formula presented.) concept. Returning to the original parameterization allows the isolation of any temporal or inter-population variation in pre- and post-recruit productivity and reduces the potential for mechanistic bias in stock-recruit parameters.},

Behavior was quantified for both predator and prey during largemouth bass feeding bouts lasting 60 minutes. Predation success (number of captures) by largemouth bass was similar at 0 and 50 stems/m 2, then declined to near zero at 250 and 1,000 stems/m 2. As stem density increased, predator activity declined due to a decrease in behaviors associated with visual contact with prey. Reduced predation success by largemouth bass in habitats of increased complexity apparently is related to increases in visual barriers provided by plant stems as well as to adaptive changes in bluegill behavio},

We show that the parameters of the VB equation are simple functions of age at maturity and reproductive investment. We use this model to show how the energy demands for both growth and reproduction trade off to determine optimal life-history traits. Assuming that both age at maturity and reproductive investment adapt to variations in adult mortality to maximize lifetime offspring production, our model predicts that: (i) the optimal age of maturity is inversely related to adult mortality rate; (ii) the optimal reproductive effort is approximately equal to adult mortality rate. These predictions are consistent with observed variations in the life-history traits of a large sample of iteroparous freshwater fishes.},

abstract = {Bocaccio rockfish (BOR) was assessed in 2019 (DFO 2020) using the Awatea catch-at-age stock assessment model platform, tuned to six fishery-independent trawl survey series (covering 1967-2019), a standardised commercial bottom trawl catch per unit effort (CPUE) series (1996-2012) 1 , annual estimates of commercial catch from two fisheries, and age composition data from the combined commercial trawl fishery and four of the six surveys. The British Columbia (BC) outside coast model started from an assumed equilibrium state in 1935. Three component base runs using a two-sex model were implemented in a Bayesian framework (using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo [MCMC] procedure) under scenarios that fixed natural mortality (M) to three levels (0.07, 0.08, 0.09) with the accumulator age (A) set to 50 years while estimating steepness of the stock-recruit function (h), catchability (q) for surveys and CPUE, and selectivity (µ) for four surveys and the commercial trawl fleet. These three runs were combined into a composite base case which explored the major axis of uncertainty (M) in the stock assessment. A summary of the 2019 stock assessment as well as descriptions of earlier Bocaccio stock assessments (including reviews of this species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) can be found in the Science Advisory Report 2020/025. The 2019 stock assessment depicted a coastwide BOR stock experiencing a nearly continuous decline from the start of the population reconstruction in 1935, interrupted only by a period of arrested decline spanning the years 1970-86 resulting from a few moderate recruitment events in 1969, 1976, and 1978. The decline resumed in 1987, continuing until an extremely large recruitment event occurred in 2016, estimated by the model to be 44 times the long-term average recruitment (5% and 95% quantiles: 30 times, 58 times). The estimated size of the initial biomass was large (median = 32,300 tonnes; 5% and 95% quantiles: 16,500 t, 71,700 t) in order to sustain the catch history while assuming deterministic recruitment during the initial years of the reconstruction. The size of this biomass implied an estimated median maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 1,461 tonnes (703, 3,623), compared to the average catch over the final five years (2015-2019) of the reconstruction of only 69 tonnes. The size of the spawning biomass at the end of the final year (2019) relative to the unfished equilibrium spawning biomass (B 2020 /B 0) was very low, estimated at 0.028 (0.013, 0.058), and B 2020 relative to equilibrium spawning biomass that would support the MSY (B 2020 /B MSY) was 0.096 (0.042, 0.23). Neither of these estimates included a contribution from the 2016 year class because it was assumed that the first four age classes had no mature females. The equivalent ratio at the end of 2019 for the biomass vulnerable to trawl gear (V 2020 /V 0) was 0.10 (0.050, 0.21). This ratio is higher than for the spawning biomass because the vulnerable biomass was determined by the selectivity function without reference to maturity status and, consequently, included a fractional contribution from the large 2016 cohort.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

abstract = {The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) goal is “to restore and maintain healthy salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity” (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2005). In order to achieve this goal, the WSP outlines a number of strategies, including ‘Strategy 1: standardized monitoring of wild salmon statuses', which is the subject of this paper. In the current paper, Fraser Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) conservation units (CUs) from ‘WSP Action Step 1.1: the identification of conservation units' are used to update ‘Action Step 1.2: the development of criteria to assess CUs and identify benchmarks to represent biological statuses', and to address ‘Action Step 1.3: CU status assessment', for the 22 current CUs and two de novo ‘CUs'. Using a previously developed toolkit for CU status assessment (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), abundance benchmarks (unique to each CU) were estimated for each CU with stock-recruitment data, and trends in abundance upper and lower benchmarks (common across all CUs) were modified to apply to Fraser Sockeye. These benchmarks were used to delineate the three WSP biological status zones (Red, Amber, and Green). Abundance benchmarks were estimated across a range of stock-recruitment models, including the standard Ricker model that assumes constant productivity and other Ricker model forms that assume time varying productivity. Consideration of time varying productivity in the estimation of abundance benchmarks was important since most Fraser Sockeye CUs have exhibited systematic declines in productivity over recent decades (Grant et al. 2011) and extirpation risk can increase when a CUs productivity is linearly decreasing or low (Holt 2009; Holt and Bradford 2011). Abundance benchmarks were also estimated across a range of probability levels to reflect uncertainty in the estimation process. Estimates of a CU's spawner abundances at maximum juvenile production (Smax) were also updated and used as carrying capacity priors in Ricker models, where available and appropriate. In the evaluation of status using the abundance metric, both the geometric and arithmetic means of the recent CU abundance were compared against benchmarks. Since multiple metrics (one abundance and three trends in abundance metrics, depending on the CU) and uncertainty in abundance benchmarks are presented in the current paper, statuses for a single CU can comprise all three WSP status zones. Status integration will be explored in future processes and publications. vii},

abstract = {Anadromous fishes are frequently restricted by artificial barriers to movement such as dams and culverts, so measuring dispersal helps identify sites where improved connectivity could promote range expansion and population viability. We used a combination of DNA-based parentage analysis and markrecapture techniques to evaluate dispersal by juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in a population in the initial stages of colonisation following installation of fish passage structures at a previously impassable dam on the Cedar River, WA, USA. The spatial distribution of individuals within maternal families revealed that dispersal was common. Among the offspring of radio-tagged mothers, 28% were collected outside the spawning reach and dispersed up to 6.3 km (median = 1.5 km). Most juveniles captured in a tributary (Rock Creek, where few adults spawned) had immigrated from the Cedar River and represented many different families. Juvenile dispersal therefore provided a secondary phase of spatial expansion following initial colonisation by adults. Consistent with the condition-dependent dispersal hypothesis, juveniles that dispersed farther upstream in the tributary were larger than fish collected near the tributary mouth. Overall, the results demonstrated widespread dispersal in a system with low coho salmon densities, and this might increase the rate of population growth if it reduces the effects of local density dependence. By implication, juveniles can take advantage of rearing habitats reconnected through barrier removal, even when such areas are located several kilometres from adult breeding grounds.},

It starts with an introduction to the mathematical models applied in Fish Stock Assessment and some considerations on the importance of fisheries. The need for a rational management of the fishing resources is then stressed, this being indispensable for an adequate exploitation, aiming at conservation, to occur. The basic assumptions about a model and the concepts of different variation rates of a characteristic in relation to time (or to other characteristics) are presented, highlighting the most important aspects of the simple and exponential linear models which are used in the chapters that follow. After some considerations on the concept of cohort, models for the evolution in time of the number and weight of the individuals that constitute the cohort are developed, including models for the individual growth of the cohort. In the chapter concerning the study of the stock, the fishing pattern and its components are defined, the most used models for the stockrecruitment relation are presented, as well as the short and long term projections of a stock. With regard to fishing resources management, the discussion is focused on the biological reference points (target points, limit points and precautionary points) and fisheries regulation measures. The last chapter, which presents and discusses theoretical models of fish stock assessment, deals with production models (also designated as general production models) and with the long and shortterm projections of the catches and biomasses. Finally, the general methods of estimating parameters are described and some of the most important methods are presented, with special relevance to the cohort analysis by age and length. Then a solution of the exercises from the last course held in IPIMAR, is presented by the author and the scientist Manuela Azevedo.},

The proposed modification is shown as an addendum that supplements the South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan (MSRP; Service 1999) by adding delisting criteria for the SNKI that were not developed at the time this recovery plan was completed.

Legal challenges to recovery plans (see Fund for Animals v. Babbitt, 903 F.

abstract = {Populations living in seasonal environments are exposed to systematic changes in physical conditions that restrict the growth and reproduction of many species to only a short time window of the annual cycle. Several studies have shown that climate changes over the latter part of the 20th century affected the phenology and population dynamics of single species. However, the key limitation to forecasting the effects of changing climate on ecosystems lies in understanding how it will affect interactions among species. We investigated the effects of climatic and biotic drivers on physical and biological lake processes, using a historical dataset of 40 years from Lake Washington, USA, and dynamic time-series models to explain changes in the phenological patterns among physical and biological components of pelagic ecosystems. Long-term climate warming and variability because of large-scale climatic patterns like Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and El Ni{\~{n}}o-southern oscillation (ENSO) extended the duration of the stratification period by 25 days over the last 40 years. This change was due mainly to earlier spring stratification (16 days) and less to later stratification termination in fall (9 days). The phytoplankton spring bloom advanced roughly in parallel to stratification onset and in 2002 it occurred about 19 days earlier than it did in 1962, indicating the tight connection of spring phytoplankton growth to turbulent conditions. In contrast, the timing of the clear-water phase showed high variability and was mainly driven by biotic factors. Among the zooplankton species, the timing of spring peaks in the rotifer Keratella advanced strongly, whereas Leptodiaptomus and Daphnia showed slight or no changes. These changes have generated a growing time lag between the spring phytoplankton peak and zooplankton peak, which can be especially critical for the cladoceran Daphnia. Water temperature, PDO, and food availability affected the timing of the spring peak in zooplankton. Overall, the impact of PDO on the phenological processes were stronger compared with ENSO. Our results highlight that climate affects physical and biological processes differently, which can interrupt energy flow among trophic levels, making ecosystem responses to climate change difficult to forecast. {\textcopyright} 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {To predict recreational-fishing impacts on freshwater fish species, it is important to understand the interplay between fish populations, anglers and management actions. We use an integrated bioeconomic model to study the importance of fish life-history type (LHT) for determining (i) vulnerability to over-exploitation by diverse angler types (generic, consumptive and trophy anglers), who respond dynamically to fishing-quality changes; (ii) regulations [i.e., minimum-size limits (MSLs) and licence densities] that maximize the social welfare of angler populations; and (iii) biological and social conditions resulting under such socially optimal regulations. We examine five prototypical freshwater species: European perch (Perca fluviatilis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), pike (Esox lucius) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). We find that LHT is important for determining the vulnerability of fish populations to overfishing, with pike, pikeperch, and bull trout being more vulnerable than perch and brown trout. Angler type influences the magnitude of fishing impacts, because of differences in fishing practices and angler-type-specific effects of LHT on angling effort. Our results indicate that angler types are systematically attracted to particular LHTs. Socially optimal minimum-size limits generally increase with LHT vulnerability, whereas optimal licence densities are similar across LHTs. Yet, both regulations vary among angler types. Despite this variation, we find that biological sustainability occurs under socially optimal regulations, with one exception. Our results highlight the importance of jointly considering fish diversity, angler diversity and regulations when predicting sustainable management strategies for recreational fisheries. Failure to do so could result in socially suboptimal management and/or fishery collapse.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. Recreational fishing effort varies across complex inland landscapes (e.g., lake-districts) and appears influenced by both angler preferences and qualities of the fishery resource, like fish size and abundance. However, fish size and abundance have an ecological trade-off within a population, thereby structuring equal-quality isopleths expressing this trade-off across the fishing landscape. Since expressed preferences of recreational anglers (i.e., site-selection of high-quality fishing opportunities among many lakes) can be analogous to optimal foraging strategies of natural predators, adopting such concepts can aid in understanding scale-dependence in fish-angler interactions and impacts of fishing across broad landscapes. Here, we assumed a fish supply-angler demand equilibria and adapted a novel bivariate measure of fishing quality based on fish size and catch rates to assess how recreational anglers influence fishing quality among a complex inland landscape. We then applied this metric to evaluate (1) angler preferences for caught and released fish compared to harvested fish, (2) the nonlinear size-numbers trade-off with uncertainty in both traits, and (3) the spatial-scale of the equilibria across 62 lakes and four independent management regions in British Columbia's (BC) rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss fishery. We found anglers had low preference for caught and released fish (∼10% of the value compared to harvested fish), which modified anglers' perception of fishing quality. Hence, fishing quality and angler effort was not influenced simply by total fish caught, but largely by harvested fish catch rates. Fishing quality varied from BC's northern regions (larger fish and more abundant) compared to southern regions (smaller fish and less abundant) directly associated with a 2.5 times increase in annual fishing effort in southern regions, suggesting that latent fishing pressure can structure the size-numbers trade-off in rainbow trout populations. The presence of two different equal-quality isopleths suggests at least two effective landscapes support co-occurring ideal free distributions of recreational fishing effort in BC's rainbow fishery. Anglers' expressed preferences among lakes interacted with density dependent growth and survival within lakes to structure a size-numbers trade-off influencing how anglers perceive fishing quality and, ultimately, distribute across complex inland landscapes.},

abstract = {One of the most spectacular phenomena in nature is the annual return of millions of salmon to spawn in their natal streams and lakes along the Pacific coast of North America. The salmon die after spawning, and the nutrients and energy in their bodies, derived almost entirely from marine sources, are deposited in the freshwater ecosystems. This represents a vital input to the ecosystems used as spawning grounds. Salmon-derived nutrients make up a substantial fraction of the plants and animals in aquatic and terrestrial habitats associated with healthy salmon populations. The decline of salmon numbers throughout much of their southern range in North America has prompted concern that the elimination of this “conveyor belt” of nutrients and energy may fundamentally change the productivity of these coastal freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and consequently their ability to support wildlife, including salmon.

Scientific or management objectives, appropriate spatial sampling, and detectability all must be considered when designing monitoring programs (Yoccoz et al. 2001). The ability to establish meaningful monitoring programs currently is compromised by a lack of information about amphibian detection probabilities. We used Pollock's robust design and capture-recapture models that included temporary emigration to test a priori hypotheses about spatial and temporal variation in salamander detection probability parameters for populations found in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Tennessee/North Carolina), USA. We explored the effects of 3 large-scale habitat characteristics (disturbance history elevation, vegetation type) and found that vegetation type and elevation were correlated with detection probabilities. Vegetation type was an important covariant in estimates of temporary emigration, conditional capture probability, and surface population size. Contrasts that isolated elevation effects were significant for all detection probability parameters except recapture probability, despite our small elevational range (330 m). When detection probability parameters have the potential to vary over time and space, investigators should develop monitoring designs that permit the estimation of detection probabilities.},

abstract = {Bottom longline and baited video camera operations were conducted at 39 stations off the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu, Maui, and Kauai during 1992.  Objectives of the 1992 cruise were to assess the precision, accuracy, and efficiency of a video camera system versus a traditional abundance index (longline catch per unit of effort [CPUE]) for juvenile pink snapper (''opakapaka''), Pristipomoides filamentosus, a commercially important eteline snapper in Hawaii.  Precision of the video samples was reevaluated with data from 18 stations sampled during 1993 off Kaneohe Bay.  The video index of the maximum number of opakapaka observed (MAXNO, the natural log-transformed mean of three camera drops) was best correlated with the log of longline CPUE (r=0.79, P<0.001, n=15).  Variation in the data for video MAXNO was nominally less than that of the longline CPUE.  No monotone trend over stations was noted in samples from 1993.  Sample sizes of 33 stations for longline and 18 stations for video would be necessary to detect two-fold changes in abundance of opakapaka at a site, based on our analysis of the two end positions of the 10 windward Oahu stations that had three quantitative deployments.  Reanalysis of power with data from the 1993 cruise indicates that a sample size of approximately 22 stations (alpha2=0.05) or approximately 17 stations (alpha2=0.1) would be necessary to detect twofold changes.},

abstract = {Spatially-separated populations often exhibit positively correlated fluctuations in abundance and other population variables, a phenomenon known as spatial synchrony. Generation and maintenance of synchrony requires forces that rapidly restore synchrony in the face of desynchronizing forces such as demographic and environmental stochasticity. One such force is dispersal, which couples local populations together, thereby synchronizing them. Theory predicts that average spatial synchrony can be a nonlinear function of dispersal rate, but the form of the dispersal rate-synchrony relationship has never been quantified for any system. Theory also predicts that in the presence of demographic and environmental stochasticity, realized levels of synchrony can exhibit high variability around the average, so that ecologically-identical metapopulations might exhibit very different levels of synchrony. We quantified the dispersal rate-synchrony relationship using a model system of protist predator-prey cycles in pairs of laboratory microcosms linked by different rates of dispersal. Paired predator-prey cycles initially were anti-synchronous, and were subject to demographic stochasticity and spatially-uncorrelated temperature fluctuations, challenging the ability of dispersal to rapidly synchronize them. Mean synchrony of prey cycles was a nonlinear, saturating function of dispersal rate. Even extremely low rates of dispersal (<0.4% per prey generation) were capable of rapidly bringing initially anti-synchronous cycles into synchrony. Consistent with theory, ecologically-identical replicates exhibited very different levels of prey synchrony, especially at low to intermediate dispersal rates. Our results suggest that even the very low rates of dispersal observed in many natural systems are sufficient to generate and maintain synchrony of cyclic population dynamics, at least when environments are not too spatially heterogeneous.},

abstract = {As the commonly-used von Bertalanffy growth function (VB) does not explicitly incorporate changes in growth due to allocation of energy to reproduction, a more flexible function could be used when attempting to model juvenile and adult growth simultaneously. Here we review biphasic growth models, with emphasis on those that explicitly incorporate the cost of reproduction, and propose two new models: the von Bertalanffy logistic-L∞ (VB log-L∞) and the Cost of Reproduction (CoR) models. We fitted the models to eight data sets from males and females of four unfished or lightly-fished Arctic lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations, and compared their fits to those of the commonly-used growth functions. In all cases, a biphasic growth model fitted the data better than simpler models such as the VB and the Richards models. Of the biphasic models, those that explicitly represent the reproductive process fitted the data best, particularly the Quince-Boukal model with the allometric exponent on the growth rate-weight relationship $\beta$ = 0.8. The proposed models and the Quince-Boukal model provide a smooth transition between juvenile and adult growth by incorporating a logistic function with parameters dependent on the proportion of mature fish (or probability of being mature) at age. In addition to fitting growth models to the size-at-age data, we also attempted an integrated estimation for the three models that predict the age at maturity (the models are simultaneously fit to two data components, size at age and maturity at age.) The integrated estimation was the best compromise between modeling the two biological processes (growth and reproduction), but the separated estimation provided similar results in most cases, and may be easier to implement. We believe that taking the cost of reproduction into consideration is central for growth curves used in stock assessment models, as changes in growth trajectories may impact the perception of stock status. Future research should focus on the sensitivity of management advice to these growth curves for commercially-important fish stocks. For data-poor stocks, the models based on first principles, such as the Quince-Boukal model, can be used to produce management advice based on life history invariants, taking into account information on metabolic rates that can be obtained from other studies.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that in teleosts there is a significant correlation between the life history parameters, age at first reproduction, natural mortality, and growth rate. In this paper 1 hypothesize that these correlations are the result of evolutionary adjustments due to the trade-off between reproduction, growth, and survival. A simple and reasonable assumption is that the costs of reproduction are sufficient to cause the ltmt function to decrease. A simple expression relating the age at first reproduction is derived from this assumption. This formula accounts for a statistically significant portion (60.6%) of the variation in age at first reproduction in 30 stocks of fish. To extend the model to predict the distribution of life history parameters across all teleosts, an explicit cost function is incorporated. The model is analyzed with respect to two fitness measures, the expected lifetime fecundity and malthusian parameter, r. In the first case it is shown that the optimal age at maturity, T, depends only on the natural mortality rate (M) and the growth rate (k). In the second case,T is a function of k and the logarithm of a parameter, In C; the latter is a product of egg and larval survival, maximum body length (Lx), and the proportionality coefficient of the fecundity/length function. Difficulties of measuring egg and larval survival make the testing of the latter case difficult for particular species. However, this method provides a simple formula for the computation of r; this is shown generally to be approximately zero, thereby adding strength to the assumptions of the first analysis. The distribution patterns of T on k and M on k are predicted and compared with the observed pattern. In general, the predictions are validated: however, certain combinations of k and lnC are shown to occur very infrequently. The prediction of such "empty" regions of the parameter space remains a challenge for future development of life history theory.},

Eleven mature female Deacon Rockfish were tagged and monitored during an 11-month period, at a nearshore rocky reef off Seal Rock, Oregon, USA, an area of recurring seasonal hypoxia (defined as dissolved oxygen concentration [DO] < 2 mg l−1). Two tags were detected leaving the study area by day 35, indicating predation or emigration. Three tags became inactive within the array, indicating tag loss or fish death. Six “resident” fish inhabited the array for 246–326 days. Resident fish exhibited high site fidelity, small home ranges (mean 95% KDE = 4907 m2), and consistent activity patterns for the duration of the summertime high-resolution array (5 months), except during seasonal hypoxia. Resident fish were strongly diurnal in summer, with high levels of daytime activity above the bottom in relatively rugose habitat, followed by nighttime rest periods in deeper, less rugose habitat. During summertime hypoxia, resident fish exhibited less daytime activity during daytime hours with no rest periods at night, inhabited shallower water depths, and moved well away from their core activity areas on long, erratic forays. During the winter, diel patterns were less evident with higher activity levels at night (than in the summer) and lower activity levels in the day (than in the summer). We propose that some Deacon Rockfish continuously inhabit nearshore reefs throughout the year, but that daily/seasonal movement patterns, seasonally occurring hypoxia, and prey preferences for planktonic organisms influence relocation.},

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

abstract = {This paper considers ocean fisheries as complex adaptive systems and addresses the question of how human institutions might be best matched to their structure and function. Ocean ecosystems operate at multiple scales, but the management of fisheries tends to be aimed at a single species considered at a single broad scale. The paper argues that this mismatch of ecological and management scale makes it difficult to address the fine-scale aspects of ocean ecosystems, and leads to fishing rights and strategies that tend to erode the underlying structure of populations and the system itself. A successful transition to ecosystem-based management will require institutions better able to economize on the acquisition of feedback about the impact of human activities. This is likely to be achieved by multiscale institutions whose organization mirrors the spatial organization of the ecosystem and whose communications occur through a polycentric network. Better feedback will allow the exploration of fine-scale science and the employment of fine-scale fishing restraints, better adapted to the behavior of fish and habitat. The scale and scope of individual fishing rights also needs to be congruent with the spatial structure of the ecosystem. Place-based rights can be expected to create a longer private planning horizon as well as stronger incentives for the private and public acquisition of system relevant knowledge.

abstract = {Okanagan Lake, south-central interior of BC, contains two reproductive ecotypes of kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka; individuals spawn in tributary streams ('stream-spawners') as well as on shoreline gravel areas ('beach-spawners'). We tested the hypothesis that these sympatric ecotypes comprise a single panmictic population by assaying variation in morphological traits and at allozyme, mitochondrial and minisatellite DNA loci in fish collected from three stream-spawning and two beach-spawning sites. No morphological traits consistently distinguished the reproductive ecotypes with the exception of the number of anal fin rays which was greater in stream-spawning kokanee. Four of 18 allozyme loci screened were polymorphic, but no significant allele frequency differences were detected among populations within ecotypes or between ecotypes. Similarly, allele frequencies at two minisatellite DNA loci were not significantly different among populations or between ecotypes. By contrast, significant differences in the frequencies of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtDNA RFLP) haplo-types were detected between stream- and beach-spawners, but not among populations within ecotypes. Further, two RFLPs that distinguished stream- and beach-spawning adults were found in juvenile kokanee sampled from the limnetic zone of Okanagan Lake. The two mtDNA RFLPs and a d-loop sequence variant appear to be unique to Okanagan Lake Kokanee because we did not observe these haplotypes in sockeye salmon and kokanee sampled outside of Okanagan Lake. Our data suggest that: (i) there is restricted female-mediated gene flow between stream- and beach-spawning kokanee in Okanagan Lake, (ii) the forms have diverged within the lake basin since the retreat of the Wisconsinian glaciers (< approximately equal to 11 000 years ago), and (iii) distinct reproductive niches may promote divergence in north temperate freshwater fish faunas.},

Alternatively, M has been estimated using theoretically and empirically derived equations, some of which require minimal data, making their use attractive for application to information-limited fisheries. Most such equations were derived from marine stock assessments and have not been validated for freshwater fishes.We used age-frequency analyses to estimate M for unexploited populations of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu, Brown Bullheads Ameiurus nebulosus, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, and Pumpkinseeds Lepomis gibbosus in the upper Hudson River, New York. We then compared our field-based estimates to M values predicted from nine published estimators. Using catch-curve regressions and the Robson and Chapman (1961) method, we estimatedMfor these populations with a sample of over 12,000 fish—nearly 2,000 of which were aged with otoliths. Variables used in the nine published estimators included maximum age, length, and weight; coefficients of the von Bertalanffy (VB) equation; the sample size used for aging; and average annual water temperature. The published estimators predictedMvalues that were fairly similar to our empirically derived values, although some estimators performed better than others. The mean of M values from the estimators was within ±0.12 units of the average derived from our age-frequency analyses. For the five estimators that utilized the VB growth relation, the M values were sensitive to changes in VB coefficients. For Largemouth Bass and Brown Bullheads, the unmodified VB growth functions did not conform to our observed length-at-age data, so we present modified VB equations for those species; coefficients derived from the modified equations appeared to provide more accurate predictions ofM. Although the published estimators ofMwere primarily developed for marine fishes, they provided fairly accurate initial estimates of M (when bounded by uncertainty) for the five freshwater species we examined.

abstract = {In a study of consumptiveness among Swedish and Norwegian anglers in Engerdal, eastern Norway, three segments of low-, mid-, and high-consumptive anglers were identified by replicating a methodology of an earlier study of North American anglers. The Engerdal anglers were somewhat more catch-oriented than the North American anglers. Anglers in Norway fish to satisfy a complex set of experience preferences. Low-consumptive anglers rate nature experiences higher than mid- and high-consumptive anglers. High-consumptive anglers have a somewhat narrower range of experience preferences and are more oriented towards competitive aspects of fishing. All anglers generally support management efforts directed toward restricting other types of use of the waters, such as reducing pollution and reducing local fishermen's leisure gill-net fishing. They also support stocking of fish, but oppose actions restricting angling. However, low-consumptive anglers do not oppose angling restrictions to the same degree as mid- and high-consumptive groups. Low-consumptive fishermen show a higher degree of specialization and report higher overall satisfaction with their fishing trips than the other two groups. {\textcopyright} 1995 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {Species diversity underpins all ecosystem services that support life. Despite this recognition and the great advances in detecting biodiversity, exactly how many and which species co-occur and interact, directly or indirectly in any ecosystem is unknown. Biodiversity accounts are incomplete; taxonomically, size, habitat, mobility or rarity biased. In the ocean, the provisioning of fish, invertebrates and algae is a fundamental ecosystem service. This extracted biomass depends on a myriad of microscopic and macroscopic organisms that make up the fabric of nature and which are affected by management actions. Monitoring them all and attributing changes to management policies is daunting. Here we propose that dynamic quantitative models of species interactions can be used to link management policy and compliance with complex ecological networks. This allows managers to qualitatively identify 'interaction-indicator' species, which are highly impacted by management policies through propagation of complex ecological interactions. We ground the approach in intertidal kelp harvesting in Chile and fishers' compliance with policies. Results allow us to identify sets of species that respond to management policy and/or compliance, but which are often not included in standardized monitoring. The proposed approach aids in the design of biodiversity programmes that attempt to connect management with biodiversity change. This article is part of the theme issue 'Detecting and attributing the causes of biodiversity change: needs, gaps and solutions'.},

To evaluate potential responses of anadromous fish populations to an increasingly variable environment, we performed a hierarchical analysis of 21 Chinook salmon populations from the Pacific Northwest, examining support for changes in river flows and flow variability on population growth. More than half of the rivers analyzed have already experienced significant increases in flow variability over the last 60 years, and this study shows that this increase in variability in freshwater flows has a more negative effect than any other climate signal included in our model. Climate change models predict that this region will experience warmer winters and more variable flows, which may limit the ability of these populations to recover.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, American Fisheries Society. Recreational fisheries are empirically tractable examples of social–ecological systems (SESs) that are characterized by complex interactions and feedbacks ranging from local to regional scales. The feedbacks among the three key compartments of the recreational fisheries SES—individual fish and populations, regionally mobile anglers, and regional and state-level fisheries managers—are strongly driven by behavior, but they are poorly understood. We review and identify factors, antecedents to behaviors, and behaviors most important to the outcomes of the coupled SES of recreational fisheries, which emerge from a range of social–ecological interactions. Using this information, we identify data gaps, suggest how to reduce uncertainty, and improve management advice for recreational fisheries focusing on open-access situations in inland fisheries. We argue that the seemingly micro-scale and local feedbacks between individual fish, fish populations, anglers, and managers lead to the emergence of important macro-scale patterns—some of which may be undesirable, such as regional overfishing. Hence, understanding the scale at which the behavior-mediated mechanisms and processes identified in this article operate is critical for managing for the sustainability of spatially structured recreational fisheries. We conclude our study by providing relevant research stimuli for the future.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly common worldwide, typically restricting fishing activities. However, MPAs may also limit scientific surveys that impact benthic habitat. We combine a historical data degradation approach and simulation to investigate the effects on population indices of excluding surveys from MPAs. Our approach quantifies losses in precision, inter-annual accuracy, trend accuracy, and power to detect trends, as well as correlates of these effects. We apply this approach to a proposed MPA network off western Canada, examining 43 groundfish species observed by four surveys. Survey exclusion particularly impacted less precise indices, species well-represented in MPAs, and those whose density shifted in or out of MPAs. Redistributing survey effort outside MPAs consistently improved precision but not accuracy or trend detection—sometimes making estimates more precise about the ‘wrong' index. While these changes may not qualitatively alter stock assessment for many species, in some cases, ∼30 percentage point reductions in power to detect simulated 50% population declines suggest meaningful impacts are possible. If survey restrictions continue expanding, index integrity could further degrade, eventually compromising the management of exploited populations. Regulating surveys within MPA boundaries therefore requires careful consideration to balance MPA objectives with the need for reliable monitoring.},

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ?functional landscape heterogeneity?. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Keywords},

Modelling studies have suggested that increased variance may foreshadow a regime shift, but this requires long-term data and knowledge of the functional links between key processes. Field-based research and ground-truthing is an essential part of the heuristic that marries theoretical and empirical research, but experimental studies of resilience are lagging behind theory, management and policy requirements. Empirically, ecological resilience must be understood in terms of community dynamics and the potential for small shifts in environmental forcing to break the feedbacks that support resilience. Here, we integrate recent theory and empirical data to identify ways we might define and understand potential thresholds in the resilience of nature, and thus the potential for regime shifts, by focusing on the roles of strong and weak interactions, linkages in meta-communities, and positive feedbacks between these and environmental drivers. The challenge to theoretical and field ecologists is to make the shift from hindsight to a more predictive science that is able to assist in the implementation of ecosystem-based management.},

A survey at a fishing competition on Pongolapoort Dam showed that anglers travel considerable distances around South Africa (73% of water bodies were >200 km, visited by 68% of the respondents). A Threat Index for freshwater bodies throughout South Africa visited by participants of the competition was calculated showing that dams in the vicinity of the infestation were more at risk from invasion. Further, the potential distribution of the weed based on climatic matching with the region of origin showed that most of the country was suitable for establishment, with the exception of the high-lying interior of the country.

abstract = {The hypothesized mechanisms reviewed in this chapter have been selected as having potential for generating low frequency variability in sardine (Sardinops spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis spp.) populations such as those experienced in the California Current, Humboldt Current, and the Benguela and Kuroshio Current systems. No generally accepted theory yet exists. An initial framework for such a theory is proposed, in which sardine productivity is linked to low frequency variability in boundary current flows, which is also related to the characteristic sea surface temperature anomalies associated with sardine productivity in these systems. During periods of weaker flow, planktonic sardine larvae are able to gain swimming capacity before being flushed from the system, allowing sardines to inhabit the main body of the boundary current. During periods of stronger flows, successful sardine reproduction is restricted to coastal waters, and productivity is relatively low. Anchovies are always restricted to coastal waters, and are more influenced by upwelling and coastal productivity; these characteristics tend to be correlated with boundary current fluctuations, giving rise to a tendency (but not requirement) of sardine and anchovy alternations. The Japanese system lacks coastal upwelling, but the cold, nutrient-rich Oyashio Current provides an analogous function. A wide variety of mechanisms can be added to this framework as appropriate to individual systems. Physical processes include patterns of boundary current flow, including current meandering and formation of cyclonic eddies. A latitudinal shift in the source water coming from the North Pacific has been identified in the California Current, and contributes to the characteristic temperature and nutrient anomalies.},

The ideal free distribution (IFD), from behavioral ecology, has proved useful for examining the relationship between vessel and resource distributions in commercial fisheries. When making inferences based upon the IFD it is critical to examine its underlying assumptions, particularly the form of competition between fishing vessels. When present, an IFD can decouple the relationship between local catch rates and abundance, obscuring declines in smaller or weaker fish stocks. As an alternative, probabilistic methods have also been successfully applied to the study of vessel behavior. However, parsimonious behavioral models like the IFD will often be preferable because (i) they can be examined using the data typically available from commercial fisheries, (ii) they require fewer data than probabilistic models, and (iii) they are easily incorporated in...},

abstract = {A model is presented that describes the breeding bird density of a species in a woodlot, given that this density may change from edge to interior. The primary variable is a measure of depth in the woodlot that depends on distances to four woodlot edges. The model applies to forest-interior species and to edge species, and it also accounts for different degrees of threat or attraction at different edges. During 1993–1996, we collected bird abundance data using point counts at 387 sample plots in 176 woodlots, including two big woods (>5000 ha), in eastern Pennsylvania, USA. Models were developed for 36 species by using nonlinear regression guided by tests of residuals against other variables measured at each sample plot. Densities of 20 of the 36 species were affected by the depth in the woodlot. The density of one forest-interior species, Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), decreased farther away from the big woods, which can be explained qualitatively by dispersal dynamics. Densities of 21 of the 36 species...},

abstract = {Gadget is the Globally applicable Area-Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox. Gadget is a powerful and flexible framework that has been developed to model complicated statistical marine ecosystems within a fisheries management and biological context, and can take many features of the ecosystem into account. Gadget allows the user to include a number of features of the ecosystem into the model: One or more species, each of which may be split into multiple components; multiple areas with migration between areas; predation between and within species; growth; mat-uration; reproduction and recruitment; multiple commercial and survey fleets taking catches from the populations. Gadget works by running an internal forward projection model based on many parameters describing the ecosystem, and then comparing the output from this model to observed measurements to get a likelihood score. The model ecosystem parameters can then be adjusted, and the model rerun , until an optimum is found, which corresponds to the model with the lowest likelihood score. This iterative, computationally intensive process is handled within Gadget , using a robust minimisation algorithm. Gadget has successfully been used to investigate the population dynamics of stock complexes in Ice-landic waters, the Barents Sea, the North Sea, the Irish and Celtic Seas and the Sofala Bank fishery of Mozambique. This paper describes the structure and main components of an ecosystem model developed using the Gadget framework.},

abstract = {A net change equation is derived for assessing no net loss of productivity of fish habitat (NNL). NNL is the guiding principle of the Canadian policy for the management of fish habitat. The equation provides a middle ground between the extremes of no conservation and no development. Projects affecting fish habitat are accountable for the productive capacity in loss areas and the difference between current and future productivities in modified areas. The equation implies quantitative conservation targets overall and loss-offsetting equivalencies in modified habitat areas. Generalization of the net change equation to heterogeneous habitats is illustrated with a development in a coastal wetland on the Great Lakes. The net change framework has implications for linkages between suitable habitat supply and fish population dynamics. Area fish habitat management plans envisioned in the policy and site-level net change assessments are connected. Quantitative ways are proposed for simultaneous assessment of NNL and “harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction” of fish habitat, as required in the Canadian Fisheries Act. Defensible methods for applying the net change equation are superior to earlier nonquantitative approaches. If the available science is insufficient, the precautionary principle is recommended. Future development steps for the quantitative net change framework are suggested.},

abstract = {1. This paper describes a novel approach to modelling of metapopulation dynamics. The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. 2. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. 3. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4. The model is fitted to data from three butterfly metapopulations. The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate). The results suggest that local populations of the three butterflies in patches of 1 ha, which may support of the order of 1000 adult butterflies, have an expected lifetime of 20-100 years.},

abstract = {The spatial dispersal of individuals is known to play an important role in the dynamics of populations, and is central to metapopulation theory. At the same time, local adaptation to environmental conditions creates a geographic mosaic of evolutionary forces, where the combined drivers of selection and gene flow interact. Although the dispersal of individuals from donor to recipient populations provides connections within the metapopulation, promoting demographic and evolutionary rescue, it may also introduce maladapted individuals into habitats host to different environmental conditions, potentially lowering the fitness of the recipient population. Here we explore a model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics between two populations connected by dispersal, where the productivity of each is defined by a trait complex that is subject to local selection. Although general in nature, our model is inspired by salmon metapopulations, where dispersal between populations is defined in terms of the straying rate, which has been shown to be density-dependent. The results of our model reveal that increased straying between evolving populations leads to alternative stable states, which has large and nonlinear effects on two measures of metapopulation robustness: the portfolio effect and the time to recovery following an induced disturbance. We show that intermediate levels of straying result in large gains in robustness, and that increased habitat heterogeneity promotes robustness when straying rates are low, and erodes robustness when straying rates are high. Finally, we show that density-dependent straying promotes robustness, particularly when the aggregate biomass is low and straying is correspondingly high, which has important ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both natural and anthropogenic disturbances.},

abstract = {Unraveling the relationship between demographic declines and genetic changes over time is of critical importance to predict the persistence of at-risk populations and to propose efficient conservation plans. This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a ‘reservoir' of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context.},

abstract = {Resolving the genetic population structure of species inhabiting pristine, high latitude ecosystems can provide novel insights into the post-glacial, evolutionary processes shaping the distribution of contemporary genetic variation. In this study, we assayed genetic variation in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from Great Bear Lake (GBL), NT and one population outside of this lake (Sandy Lake, NT) at 11 microsatellite loci and the mtDNA control region (d-loop). Overall, population subdivision was low, but significant (global F(ST) $\theta$ = 0.025), and pairwise comparisons indicated that significance was heavily influenced by comparisons between GBL localities and Sandy Lake. Our data indicate that there is no obvious genetic structure among the various basins within GBL (global F(ST) = 0.002) despite the large geographic distances between sampling areas. We found evidence of low levels of contemporary gene flow among arms within GBL, but not between Sandy Lake and GBL. Coalescent analyses suggested that some historical gene flow occurred among arms within GBL and between GBL and Sandy Lake. It appears, therefore, that contemporary (ongoing dispersal and gene flow) and historical (historical gene flow and large founding and present-day effective population sizes) factors contribute to the lack of neutral genetic structure in GBL. Overall, our results illustrate the importance of history (e.g., post-glacial colonization) and contemporary dispersal ecology in shaping genetic population structure of Arctic faunas and provide a better understanding of the evolutionary ecology of long-lived salmonids in pristine, interconnected habitats.},

We analyzed spatial and temporal trends in shark bites on sea otters in California, assessing the frequency of shark bite wounds in 1,870 carcasses collected since 1985. The proportion of stranded sea otters having shark bites has increased sharply since 2003, and white shark bites now account for >50% of recovered carcasses. The trend was most pronounced in the southern part of the range, from Estero Bay to Point Conception, where shark bite frequency has increased eightfold. Seasonal trends were also evident: most shark-bitten carcasses are recovered in late summer and fall; however, the period of elevated shark bite frequency has lengthened. The causes of these trends are unclear, but possible contributing factors include increased white shark abundance and/or changes in white shark behavior and distribution. In particular, the spatiotemporal patterns of shark-bitten sea otters match increases in pinniped populations, and the increased availability of marine mammal prey for white sharks may have led to more sharks spending more time in nearshore waters utilized by both sea otters and pinnipeds.},

Density dependence has been observed in overall spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha production, but it is not clear how patterns observed at the aggregate level relate to individual populations within the basin. We used a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to explore the degree of density dependence in juvenile production for nine Idaho populations. Our results indicate that density dependence is ubiquitous, although its strength varies between populations. We also investigated the processes driving the population-level pattern and found density-dependent growth and mortality present for both common life-history strategies, but no evidence of density-dependent movement. Overwinter mortality, spatial clustering of redds and limited resource availability were identified as potentially important limiting factors contributing to density dependence. The ubiquity of density dependence for these threatened populations is alarming as stability at present low abundance levels suggests recovery may be difficult without major changes. We conclude that density dependence at the population level is common and must be considered in demographic analysis and management.},

abstract = {We, the Ha{\'{i}}{\l}zaqv, Kitasoo Xai'xais, Nuxalk and Wuikinuxv First Nations, are the traditional stewards of our territories in the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Our traditional laws obligate us to manage and protect our territories for current and future generations. Spatial management is inherent to our cultures through the Hereditary Chief governance system, in which specific people within a lineage inherit the rights and responsibilities for stewarding specific areas. Since the 19th century, we have been experiencing cultural disruptions caused by settler colonialism, which are now worsened by the declines of marine species vital to our cultures. These declines reflect fishery impacts exacerbated by climate change. Western fisheries management focuses on maximum sustained yields (MSY), ignoring body size declines that disrupt food webs and diminish population productivity for vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, thereby eroding resilience to climate change. The worldview encompassed by the MSY framework—take the most that you can without compromising future exploitation while assuming no environmental change—is the antithesis of ours—take only what you need and leave lots for the ecosystem. Furthermore, standard stock assessments do not account for uncertainties inherent to climate change effects on distributions and productivity, and many by-catch species are unassessed. Consistent with our traditional knowledge, scientific evidence indicates that marine protected areas (MPAs), coupled with other measures to reduce fishing mortality, can restore exploited species, safeguard biodiversity and contribute to fisheries sustainability. In the 2000s, we paired Indigenous knowledge and Western science to develop marine spatial plans. These plans are foundational in our contribution to the ongoing development of the Marine Protected Area Network for Canada's Northern Shelf Bioregion (MPAN-NSB), for which we are co-governance partners with 14 other First Nations and the governments of Canada and British Columbia. Our proposed spatial protections for the MPAN-NSB encompass areas important to many exploited taxa and to corals, sponges, eelgrass beds and other carbon stores. Their implementation would fill conservation gaps which have persisted under current fishery management. Given our history of spatial management through the Hereditary Chief governance system, the MPAN-NSB is a culturally appropriate way forward for marine conservation in our territories.

abstract = {Three underwater stereo-video techniques were used to sample the relative densities and species richness of temperate reef fish assemblages at three reef locations and two habitats (high- and low-relief reef) within Ha- melin Bay, south-western Australia. The three tech- niques compared were diver-operated stereo-video strip transects, baited remote stereo-video and unbaited re- mote stereo-video. While unbaited remote stereo-video and diver-operated stereo-video transects recorded greater species richness at high compared to low-relief reefs, baited remote stereo-video recorded similar species richness at the two habitat types. The diver-operated stereo-video system was manoeuvred through caves and under overhangs recording small, cryptic, cave-dwelling species that were not recorded by either remote video techniques (Trachinops noarlungae, Trachinops brauni, Chromis klunzingeri, Trachichthys australis). Both re- mote video techniques recorded greater species richness and relative density of the most common species of Labridae, Ophthalmolepsis lineolatus. Baited remote vi- deo recorded the rarer, large predatory fish species (e.g. Seriola hippos, Glaucosoma hebraicum, Heterodontus portusjacksoni). None of the techniques sampled small cryptic fish families such as Gobiidae or Blenniidae. A combination of survey techniques is recommended for comprehensive fishery-independent studies that aim to sample broad components of fish assemblages.},

abstract = {Diluted bitumen (dilbit) from Alberta oil sands (Canada) is transported across major continental watersheds, yet little is known about its toxicity to fish if spilled into aquatic environments. The toxicity of Cold Lake (CLB) dilbit was assessed for medaka embryos (Oryzias latipes) exposed to water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) using Corexit{\textregistered}EC9500A as dispersant. The effects of CLB toxicity were similar to conventional crude oils and Access Western Blend (AWB) dilbit. The prevalence of malformations and cyp1a mRNA synthesis in hatched fish increased monotonically with concentration during WAF and CEWAF treatments and provided a novel indicator of dilbit PAH toxicity. Apart from nfe2 (an antioxidant transcription factor), there were no statistically significant monotonic exposure-responses of ahr, arnt2, cat, sod, gpx, gst, gsr, g6pdh, p53, and hsp70 transcripts at total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH) concentrations bracketing EC50s for embryotoxicity (WAF ≅ 3 $\mu$g/L; CEWAF ≅ 0.1 $\mu$g/L TPAH). Based on measured TPAH concentrations in exposure test solutions, CLB dilbit was 6–10 fold more toxic to medaka than AWB during chronic exposures. Lack of direct monotonic gene transcription responses to increasing oil concentrations during exposures that were embryotoxic suggests that the capacity of the oxidative stress response is limited in earlier lifestages or that differences exist among species in mechanisms of toxicity. This study provides a comparative framework for identifying suitable biomarkers and toxicity methods for those fish species in sensitive lifestages at highest risk of Canadian oil sands dilbit exposure following a spill in the freshwater environment.},

Populations were resampled over a 2-year period to determine which species and size combination had the highest growth and survival rates. Fish were tested for M. cerebralis via polymerase chain reaction and pepsin-trypsin digest analyses. Growth and survival rates between the species and size groups were not significantly different in either river. In the Dolores River, annual survival for both species and sizes of fish combined ranged from 0.063 to 0.12. In the Cache la Poudre River, survival for both sizes of rainbow trout was 0.004; survival for cutthroat trout ranged from 0.182 to 0.53. Larger fish had higher growth rates than smaller fish, and cutthroat trout had higher rates than similar sizes of rainbow trout. In both rivers, a higher percentage of the rainbow trout sample was infected than in the cutthroat trout sample. Rainbow trout also had a higher mean number of spores per head than cutthroat trout, and small rainbow trout had higher spore counts than large rainbow trout. Survival rates for cutthroat trout in the Cache la Poudre River were the highest of any of the groups, suggesting a difference that is biologically significant. Raising fingerlings to sizes greater than 100 mm can improve poststocking survival. If rainbow trout are stocked into contaminated waters, raising fingerlings to a larger size does not appear to improve growth or survival rates. Stocking rainbow trout in the spring could maximize growth rates but will expose fish to greater triactinomyxon densities, resulting in higher intensities of infection.},

We test the hypothesis that resistance to environmental stresses is lost under laboratory adaptation. For both traits, there was a rapid loss of resistance over a three-year period. The rapidity of the response suggested that mutation accumulation could not account for it. Rather, resistance to environmental stresses appeared to be lost as a correlated response to selection on another trait, such as early fertility, with which stress resistance is negatively genetically correlated. These results suggest that caution is needed when extrapolating from evolution of stress resistance in long-established laboratory stocks to patterns of responses and correlated responses in natural populations.},

We examined more than 60 years of global fisheries landings data to evaluate the socioeconomic and ecological implications of the compositional change in global fisheries, and propose that direct and indirect anthropogenic alterations and enhancements to ecosystems continue to benefit crustaceans. Crustaceans are among the most valuable seafood, but provide low nutritional yields and drive 94% of the projected increase of global fishery carbon emissions, due to low capture efficiency. Unequivocally, the increasing global demand for luxury seafood comes with serious environmental costs, but also appears to offer lucrative fishing opportunities. The potential for more prosperous fisheries carries unevaluated risks, highlighting the need for a nuanced perspective on global fisheries trade-offs. Addressing this unique suite of trade-offs will require substantive changes in both science and management.},

abstract = {The quantity, quality, and distribution of salmonid habitats in the Skagit and Stillaguamish River basins have changed dramatically in response to post-glacial landscape evolution and volcanism over the last 16,000 years, and the more re-cent history of land use (approximately 150 years). After retreat of the Cordil- leran ice sheet about 16,000 years ago, streams incised rapidly into valley-filling glacial sediments, lowering valley floors and creating terraces. Mainstems and floodplain sloughs on valley floors provided the majority of habitat, but moder-ate-gradient tributaries on terraces provided additional habitat for some salmon-ids. Channels in bedrock terrain were too steep to support anadromous salmonids and remain so today. Voluminous lahars from Glacier Peak approximately 5,500 years before present created an extensive low-gradient delta on the Skagit River, which then developed abundant habitats in wetlands and distributary channels. Since non-Native American settlers arrived in the mid-1800s, removal of beaver ponds, diking, ditching, and dredging of streams on the floodplains and deltas has isolated or obliterated approximately 50% of the coho salmon winter rearing habitat in both basins. These losses are associated mainly with agricultural prac- tices, which occupy the same landforms as the majority of historical coho salmon habitat. Forestry activities are concentrated on the steeper slopes of the glacial sediments and bedrock terrain, and contribute to habitat losses by increasing sediment supplies and reducing wood abundance. Understanding the interplay of Holocene landscape evolution, geomorphic processes, land use, and salmonid habitat provides a context for developing habitat restoration programs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} CSIRO 2015. Underwater video cameras (UVC) provide a non-lethal technique to sample fish in dense submersed aquatic vegetation. Fish often inhabit densely vegetated areas, but deficiencies of most sampling gears bias relative abundance estimates that inform fisheries management. This study developed methods using UVC to estimate relative abundance in dense vegetation using three experimental ponds covered with surface-matted hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) stocked at different densities of Lepomis spp. and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). We conducted UVC point counts over 13 weeks to measure relative fish abundance and occurrence from video analysis. Ponds were then drained to obtain true fish densities. In total, fish were detected in 55% of all counts and juvenile and adult Lepomis spp. and largemouth bass were enumerated. End-of-season true fish densities ranged across ponds (from 52 to 37000 fishha-1). Additionally, pond 2's true density changed substantially from 370 to 12300 fishha-1. True population size was accurately reflected in differences in estimated relative abundances obtained from fish counts, as in pond 2 where mean fish counts increased from 0.10 in week 1 to 2.33 by week 13. Underwater video accurately and precisely quantified relative abundance at naturally-occurring fish densities, but this success was reduced at low densities.},

abstract = {We used environmentally dependent surplus production (EDSP) models to test hypotheses linking changes in habitat area, carrying capacity and surplus production in California sardine (Sardinops sagax). Habitat area (with mean sea surface temperatures of 14-16°C) was centered off Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia during July-December and off southern and central California during January-June. Habitat area increased during El Ni{\~{n}}o and decreased during La Ni{\~{n}}a events. EDSP models fit better than a conventional Fox surplus production model without environmental data. Our estimated fishing mortality rate at maximum sustained yield FMSY = 0. 099{\textperiodcentered}year-1 was consistent with other estimates. Maximum sustained yield (MSY) and stock biomass for MSY (BMSY) depend on habitat area and environmental conditions. Negative surplus production occurred when biomass was high and habitat area declined abruptly. Managers might monitor habitat area to anticipate changes in the California sardine stock and changes in the California Current ecosystem. Periods of high productivity appear easier to identify than periods of negative productivity. Models that incorporate environmental effects on both recruitment and survival and mortality of adult fish appear useful in studying climatic effects on fishery surplus production. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC.},

The model is constructed as a generalized incidence function, which describes how the fraction of occupied habitat patches depends on patch areas and isolations. 2. The model may be fitted to presence/absence data from a metapopulation at a dynamic equilibrium between extinctions and colonizations. 3. Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4. The model is fitted to data from three butterfly metapopulations. The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate). The results suggest that local populations of the three butterflies in patches of 1 ha, which may support of the order of 1000 adult butterflies, have an expected lifetime of 20-100 years.},

abstract = {Rushed efforts to repair freshwater ecosystems are obstructing the scientific assessment of successes and failures. Existing ecosystem science is ignored as ecologists plan restoration projects. The problem of detecting fish responses to habitat alterations is reviewed via linked issues: expectations, measures, variability, and scale. Habitat alterations directed at single species populations usually affect other ecosystem components. In the fish community, no single population is the reference point for detecting responses. A set of 15 alternate responses highlights the need for an array of ecological indicators if alternatives are to be distinguished. Potential measures are surveyed. Patterns and sources of spatial and temporal variability are identified. Integrative indicators such as production and community indices may be more suitable for detecting changes as they exhibit less variability. The spatial and temporal scales of ecosystem responses are usually greater than the scales of human interventions and assessment. Guidelines for designing assessments are recommended. Management actions are experiments and must be assessed as such. Learning requires systematic observation with replicates and controls. Restoration plans must focus more on ecosystems and less on preferred species. Given the scales of experimentation required, larger opportunities for useful science must be created by wider coordination, consultation, and cooperation.},

Diets before and after SAV reduction were generally similar for fish greater than stock-size >= (N203 mm) in the Spring Creek arm; however, fewer invertebrates were consumed after SAV reduction. Low diet similarity was observed in smaller fish, caused by a decline in consumption of grass shrimp and sunfishes and an increase in use of damselflies, shiners Notropis spp., and topminnows Fundulus spp. after SAV reduction. Diets were similar between the same time periods for all sizes of fish in the Chattahoochee River arm. These results agreed with many laboratory results describing the effects of aquatic plant density on largemouth bass food consumption and growth, and demonstrated that increased predation efficiency resulting from decreased plant abundance was likely a stronger factor determining growth rates than any potential diet shift that may occur as a result in vegetation decline.},

abstract = {Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) are a common marine fish in nearshore and continental shelf environments in the North Pacific Ocean. They are frequently identified in coastal archaeological sites in western North America; however, the morphological similarity of rockfish species limits conventional zooarchaeological identifications to the genus level. This study applies ancient DNA analysis to 96 archaeological rockfish specimens from four sites on separate islands in an archipelago on western Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Two of the archaeological sites are located within a marine protected area specifically designed to facilitate the recovery of inshore rockfish populations; two sites are located outside this boundary and remain subject to considerable fishing pressure. Using mitochondrial 16S and control region DNA sequences, we identify at least twelve different rockfish species utilized during the past 2,500 years. Identification of rockfish at closely spaced and contemporaneously occupied sites confirms that a variety of Sebastes species were consistently exploited at each site, with more exposed areas having a higher number of species present. Identification results indicate that four of the twelve species did not occur within the conservation area boundary and, instead, were found in sites where commercial and recreational fishing continues to be permitted. This study demonstrates that ancient DNA identifications of archaeological assemblages can complement and expand perspective on modern day fisheries conservation and management in this National Park Reserve and First Nations ancestral territory.},

abstract = {We studied the relation between aquatic vegetation coverage, summer dissolved oxygen and density of sunfishes {(Lepomis} spp.) in 10 shallow bays of a eutrophic reservoir. The bays ranged 5.2-15.7 ha in area, 0.6-1.3 m mean depth and 6-91% vegetation area coverage. Over the 10 bays mean dissolved oxygen concentration ranged 5.8-9.0 mg 1(-1) in open water at least 20 m away from the vegetation, 0.8-8.1 mg 1(-1) at the vegetation-water edge and 0.5-7.7 mg 1(-1) in dense vegetation. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were inversely related to vegetation coverage. In open water, dissolved oxygen levels were consistently higher than 8 mg 1(-1) when vegetation coverage was {\textless}20% of the bay and decreased to about 6 mg 1(-1) at coverages near 80%. At the vegetation-water edge and within dense vegetation, dissolved oxygen levels dropped rapidly as vegetation coverage increased to 20% of the bay; when vegetation reached about 50% coverage, dissolved oxygen remained near 1.5 mg 1(-1) at the vegetation-water edge, but oxygen dropped below 1 mg 1(-1) in dense vegetation. Scarce vegetation harbored high Lepomis relative abundance (fish per m(2) of vegetation) whereas extensive vegetation harbored low relative abundance, both contributing little to absolute abundance (total fish in all vegetation); however, intermediate coverage offered a combination of mid-level fish relative abundance that together with mid-level plant coverage translated into high absolute fish abundance. We suggest this response is related to hypoxia, and where aquatic vegetation is extensive, the effect of vegetation on hypoxia and water quality in general may influence fish populations in a way similar to that often attributed to reduced foraging efficiency and increased competitive interactions.},

Our goal was to perform a simulation test of a suite of HCRs using an age-structured predator–prey model to represent the dynamics of a small pelagic fish, Atlantic menhaden ( Brevoortia tyrannus), and its predator, striped bass ( Morone saxatilis). We evaluated a suite of static and dynamic single and multispecies HCRs to estimate effects on stock performance metrics. No single HCR achieved ecosystem management objectives for both stocks given their current reference points, but HCRs that involved the “40–10 rule” for striped bass performed well across all predator performance metrics. The most influential factor determining performance of striped bass HCRs was striped bass fishing mortality, and relatively few HCRs achieved target SSB for Atlantic menhaden. Our study indicated that some HCRs recommended for forage fish management may not be effective in systems with generalist predators, and that ecosystem management objectives might be achievable by simultaneously adopting HCRs for both predator and prey stocks that complement one another.},

Fifteen of 19 populations showed evidence of a significant decrease in growth rate with increasing density. In 11 of these 15 populations, the pattern of density-dependent growth was better described by a negative power curve than by a linear regression (i.e. Akaike Information Criterion, AIClinear - AICpower > 2), whereas only one population was better described by a linear regression than by a negative power curve; three populations were adequately described by both models (AIC < 2). In 10 of the 11 populations that were best described by a negative power curve, most of the decrease in growth rate occurred at population densities <1 fish m-2, when space limitation is unlikely. This analysis provides broad support for the hypothesis that density-dependent growth in stream salmonids occurs primarily at low population densities, probably due to exploitative competition. {\textcopyright} The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, 2005.},

We study selection differentials on three life-history traitsreproductive investment, size at maturation, and growth capacityunder size-selective exploitation of northern pike (Esox lucius L.) with recreational-fishing gear. An age-structured population model is presented that accounts for the eco-evolutionary feedback arising from density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection. By introducing minimum-length limits, maximum-length limits, and combinations of such limits (resulting in harvestable-slot length limits) into the model, we examine the potential of simple management tools for mitigating selection pressures induced by recreational fishing. With regard to annual reproductive investment, we find that size-selective fishing mortality exerts relatively small positive selection differentials. By contrast, selection differentials on size at maturation are large and consistently negative. Selection differentials on growth capacity are often large and positive, but become negative when a certain range of minimum-length limits are applied. In general, the strength of selection is reduced by implementing more stringent management policies, but each life-history trait responds differently to the introduction of specific harvest regulations. Based on a simple genetic inheritance model, we examine mid- and long-term evolutionary changes of the three life-history traits and their impacts on the size spectrum and yield of pike. Fishing-induced evolution often reduces sizes and yields, but details depend on a variety of factors such as the specific regulation in place. We find no regulation that is successful in reducing to zero all selection pressures on life-history traits induced by recreational fishing. Accordingly, we must expect that inducing some degree of evolution through recreational fishing is inevitable.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are powerful management tools used worldwide for conserving marine species and habitats. Yet, many MPAs fail to achieve their management objectives because of shortfalls in understanding the level of legitimacy stakeholders afford to an MPA. Legitimacy refers to the ability of a political action, in this case an MPA, to be perceived as right and just by the various people who are involved, interested, and/or affected by it. Using responses from key stakeholders and managers at two coastal MPAs in Atlantic Canada, this study examined the importance of various factors shaping perceptions of MPA effectiveness and the role of legitimacy in influencing those perceptions. Results indicate that most indicators of legitimacy are important to stakeholders for MPA effectiveness. Specifically, there was consensus across case studies on the importance of community leadership and the establishment of trust in determining the level of legitimacy afforded to MPAs. However key differences in perceptions were evident from stakeholders both between and within groups, and between stakeholders and MPA managers. A novel legitimacy framework and a stakeholder-vetted suite of indicators for legitimacy are presented and recommended for use by MPA managers in assessing the legitimacy of coastal MPAs, before, during and after MPA designation. The results provide an increased understanding of stakeholders' perceptions of legitimacy, giving managers key additional information needed to establish effective MPAs in the future.},

Two linked components of stability have large consequences for persistence: first, statistical stability as the lack of temporal fluctuations; second, synchronisation as an aspect of dynamic stability, which erodes metapopulation rescue effects. Here, we determine the influence of river network structure on the stability of riverine metapopulations. We introduce an approach that converts river networks to metapopulation networks, and analytically show how fluctuation magnitude is influenced by interaction structure. We show that river metapopulation complexity (in terms of branching prevalence) has nonlinear dampening effects on population fluctuations, and can also buffer against synchronisation. We conclude by showing that river transects generally increase synchronisation, while the spatial scale of interaction has nonlinear effects on synchronised dynamics. Our results indicate that this dual stability - conferred by fluctuation and synchronisation dampening - emerges from interaction structure in rivers, and this may strongly influence the persistence of river metapopulations.},

These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries.

abstract = {Ecosystem-based fishery management requires considering the effects of actions on social, natural and economic systems. These considerations are important for forage fish fisheries, because these species provide ecosystem services as a key prey in food webs and support valuable commercial fisheries. Forage fish stocks fluctuate naturally, and fishing may make these fluctuations more pronounced, yet harvest strategies intended to ameliorate these effects might adversely affect fisheries and communities. Here, we evaluate trade-offs among a diverse suite of management objectives by simulating outcomes from several harvest strategies on forage fish species. We demonstrate that some trade-offs (like those between catches and minimizing collapse length) were universal among forage species and could not be eliminated by the use of different control rules. We also demonstrate that trade-offs vary among forage fish species, with strong trade-offs between stable, high catches and high-biomass periods (“bonanzas”) for menhaden- and anchovy-like fish, and counterintuitive trade-offs for sardine-like fish between shorter collapses and longer bonanzas. We find that harvest strategies designed to maintain stability in catches will result in more severe collapses. Finally, we show that the ability of assessments to detect rapid changes in population status greatly affects control rule performance and the degree and type of trade-offs, increasing the risk and severity of collapses and reducing catches. Together, these results demonstrate that while default harvest strategies are useful in data-poor situations, management strategy evaluations that are tailored to specific forage fish may better balance trade-offs.},

abstract = {Herring Clupea harengus often spawns in waves which result in a succession of larval cohorts. First-time (recruit) spawners generally spawn later than repeat spawners and it is suggested that spawning proceeds consecutively through year classes from oldest to youngest due to differential maturahon. Further, it is suggested $\sim$t 1s the large reproductive contribution of dominant year classes that gives the appearance of spawning waves; thus the number and relative size of these waves relates directly to the age structure of the reproductive population. In this paper historical data on the Norwegian spring-spawning herring stock are reworked in support of the hypothesis. An age-specific progression through annual maturation stages is demonstrated. This relation gives mean time of spawning by age which, combined with information on the age frequency distribution and age-specific fecundity, allows prediction of the duration of the spawning season and the intensity of spawning over time. Predictions agree well with observations made at actual spawning sites. Furthermore, it is probable that recruitment is, in part, dependent on the age structure of the mature population. The higher the number of age classes in the reproductive populahon the greater appears the likelihood of good recruitment.},

abstract = {Effective management of recreational fishing requires understanding fishers and their actions. These actions constitute critical links between social and ecological systems that result in outcomes that feedback and influence recreational fishers' actions and the management of these actions. Although much research exists on recreational fishers and their actions, this research is often disconnected from management issues. One way to help to overcome this disconnect is to illustrate how past research on the social component of recreational fishing fits within an emerging coupled social-ecological system (SES) framework. Herein, a conceptual SES is first developed with specific attention to recreational fisheries. This SES is then used to illustrate the importance of considering human dimensions research for articulating, studying and ultimately managing key outcomes of recreational fisheries (e.g. fish population conservation, fisher well-being) using the example of harvest regulations and a brief review of past interdisciplinary research on recreational fishing. The article ends by identifying key research needs including understanding: how factors such as management rules affect the diversity of actions by recreational fishers; how governance and management approaches adapt to changing social and resource conditions; and how recreational fishers learn and share information.},

abstract = {Multispecies modeling is being increasingly accepted in stock assessment, especially in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF). To achieve a future implementation of an EAF in the Flemish Cap, we present a multispecies model developed in Gadget, which covers the main commercial stocks over the period 1988–2012: cod (Gadus morhua), redfish (Sebastes spp.), and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The model highlights the interdependent dynamic of these stocks and reveals strong interactions among recruitment, fishing, and predation (including cannibalism). These drivers have shown marked changes in their relative importance by species, age, and length over time, producing a transition from a traditional redfish- and cod-dominated system in the early 1990s to an intermediate shrimp and other fish species state by the late 1990s and in turn back to something close to the initial state by the late 2000s. The multispecies model developed in this paper shows that disregarding the species interactions would lead to serious underestimates of natural mortality and overestimations of the exploitable biomass and highlights the need to move beyond single-species management in this highly coupled ecosystem.},

To determine the degree to which changes in productivity are shared and to help identify environmental variables that might be related to those changes, we estimated the magnitude and spatial characteristics of positive correlations in productivity trends among stocks separated by various distances. We used Dynamic Factor Analysis to characterize shared time trends in productivity and found that these trends were most closely associated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and, to a lesser extent, with the location of the bifurcation in the North Pacific Current as it reaches North America's west coast. Chinook productivity patterns of separate populations have also become more synchronous in recent years, similar to results reported for other species of Pacific salmon. Such recent changes may reduce the resilience of the species to effects of climate change and habitat modification.},

abstract = {We use a new, well-calibrated 500 year paleorecord off southern California to determine collapse frequency, cross correlation, persistence, and return times of exploited forage fish populations. The paleorecord shows that “collapse” (defined as <10% of the mean peak biomass) is a normal state repeatedly experienced by northern anchovy, Pacific hake, and Pacific sardine which were collapsed 29–40% of the time, prior to commercial fishing exploitation. Mean (± SD) persistence of “fishable biomass” (defined as one third mean peak biomass from the paleorecord) was 19 ± 18, 15 ± 17, and 12 ± 7 years for anchovy, hake, and sardine. Mean return times to the same biomass was 8 years for anchovy but 22 years for sardine and hake. Further, we find that sardine and anchovy are positively correlated over 400 years, consistent with coherent declines of both species off California. Persistence and return times combined with positive sardine-anchovy correlation indicate that on average 1–2 decades of fishable biomass will be followed by 1–2 decades of low forage. Forage populations are resilient on the 500 year time scale, but their collapse and recovery cycle (based on the paleorecord) are suited to alternating periods of high fishing mortality and periods of little or no fishing.},

abstract = {Monthly visual surveys of reef fish populations in the Florida Keys were conducted from May to September of 1999 and April to December of 2000 using both strip transect and stationary point count sampling methods. Each month divers using SCUBA conducted three 10 m × 30 m transect surveys and three 5 m radius stationary point counts at 26 sites selected using a habitat based, stratified random design procedure. During both sampling procedures divers enumerated and assigned to 5 cm size increments all groupers (Serranidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), hogfish (Labridae), angelfish (Pomacanthidae), butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae), triggerfish (Balistidae), and a few other species of recreational or commercial importance. The rationale behind this sampling design was to assess the differential vulnerability of the various species and size classes to the lower behavioral disturbance/smaller area point count technique as compared to the higher disturbance/larger area transect method, and to assess which method would produce the highest density estimates and census the largest number of individuals per unit of sampling effort for size structure determinations. Although both types of samples required about the same amount of diver effort to complete, approximately 1.5 times more individuals were recorded during transect surveys. However, since transect surveys encompassed 4.3 times as much area as point counts, observed densities averaged about three times higher for point count samples. There was considerable variation among species with respect to this pattern, with total numbers of individuals for the 10 most abundant species ranging from about equal to 4.5 times higher during transect surveys, while densities ranged from nearly equal to about 6 times higher during point counts. Length frequencies within species were generally very similar between the two methods, though a higher proportion of larger individuals was recorded for a few species during transect surveys. Since previous studies have strongly indicated that visual census techniques produce underestimates of true reef fish densities, the higher and presumably more accurate density estimates provided by the point count method, along with other factors such as presumed increases in accuracy of counts and size estimates associated with increased observation time of individual fishes, led us to select this method for our future surveys.},

abstract = {Ocean systems, and the culturally and commercially important fishes that inhabit them, face growing threats. Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to inform fisheries research and management for data-poor species. Listed as a species of special concern in Canada, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of this species over the last $\sim$60 years, and the factors driving these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size and abundance were compared with current biological survey data. Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out and 89% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance since their earliest fishing experiences (1950s to1980s, depending on participant's age), with a third suggesting the change was most evident in the early 2000s, followed by the 1980s (21%) and 1990s (17%). Sizes of modern yelloweye rockfish estimated by participants resembled estimates derived from ecological data recorded concurrently at the study region. This study illustrates a repeatable method for using traditional and local knowledge to extend baselines for data-poor species, and highlights the value of integrating Indigenous knowledge into fisheries research and management.},

abstract = {Abstract Marine fisheries in coastal ecosystems in many areas of the world have historically removed large-bodied individuals, potentially impairing ecosystem functioning and the long-term sustainability of fish populations. Reporting on size-based indicators that link to food-web structure can contribute to ecosystem-based management, but the application of these indicators over large (cross-ecosystem) geographical scales has been limited to either fisheries-dependent catch data or diver-based methods restricted to shallow waters (<20 m) that can misrepresent the abundance of large-bodied fished species. We obtained data on the body-size structure of 82 recreationally or commercially targeted marine demersal teleosts from 2904 deployments of baited remote underwater stereo-video (stereo-BRUV). Sampling was at up to 50 m depth and covered approximately 10,000 km of the continental shelf of Australia. Seascape relief, water depth, and human gravity (i.e., a proxy of human impacts) were the strongest predictors of the probability of occurrence of large fishes and the abundance of fishes above the minimum legal size of capture. No-take marine reserves had a positive effect on the abundance of fishes above legal size, although the effect varied across species groups. In contrast, sublegal fishes were best predicted by gradients in sea surface temperature (mean and variance). In areas of low human impact, large fishes were about three times more likely to be encountered and fishes of legal size were approximately five times more abundant. For conspicuous species groups with contrasting habitat, environmental, and biogeographic affinities, abundance of legal-size fishes typically declined as human impact increased. Our large-scale quantitative analyses highlight the combined importance of seascape complexity, regions with low human footprint, and no-take marine reserves in protecting large-bodied fishes across a broad range of species and ecosystem configurations.},

abstract = {In 1958, Sidney Holt developed a model to determine the optimal mass at which to harvest a cohort of fish having von Bertalanffy growth and experiencing constant natural mortality. Holt and Ray Beverton then gave a life-history interpretation to the analysis, from which Beverton developed a theory of Growth, Maturity, and Longevity (GML) that allows one to predict quantities such as age at maturity or relative size at maturity using life-history parameters. I extend their results in two ways. First, keeping the original formulation, in which the rate of natural mortality is constant, I show how one can invert Beverton's result to determine the rate of natural mortality from life-history data. I illustrate this inverse method with data on three species of tuna and compare the estimates with those based on tagging. Second, I extend Beverton's GML theory to include size-dependent mortality. I explore previously published mortality models and introduce a new mortality function that has size-independent and size-dependent components. I show that the new size-dependent mortality function leads to the prediction that age at maturity depends upon asymptotic size (as well as the other life-history parameters), something that Beverton's original theory lacked. I illustrate this extension with a simple example, discuss directions for future work and conclude that nearly 60 years on these contributions of Holt and Beverton continue to lead us in new and exciting directions.},

Uncertainty is, however, pervasive and its characterization is essential if we are to understand our effects on ecosystems. Traditional fisheries management has a poor track record for confronting uncertainty, but most management authorities are now committed to a precautionary approach. As a result, some of the most interesting methods for taking account of uncertainty in ecological systems have been developed by fisheries scientists. These methods evaluate the relative performance of different management procedures with the use of mathematical and statistical models that synthesize knowledge and speculation about the system of interest. Recent advances in computer-intensive statistics have made it possible to combine this approach with model fitting, so that the uncertainties and risks associated with different outcomes of management can be quantified. We show how this methodology can be applied to a range of ecological problems where the advice that scientists provide to decision makers is likely to be clouded by uncertainty.},

abstract = {[ABSTRACT. Archaeological data on the long history of interaction between indigenous people and salmon have rarely been applied to conservation management. When joined with ethnohistoric records, archaeology provides an alternative conceptual view of the potential for sustainable harvests and can suggest possible social mechanisms for managing human behavior. Review of the $\sim$7,500-year-long fish bone record from two subregions of the Pacific Northwest shows remarkable stability in salmon use. As major changes in the ecological and social system occurred over this lengthy period, persistence in the fishery is not due simply to a lack of perturbation, but rather indicates resilience in the ecological–human system. Of several factors possibly contributing to resilience, low human population size and harvesting pressure, habitat enhancement, and suppression of competing predators do not appear to be of major importance. Flexible resource use, including human use of a range of local resources, many of which are linked in a food web with salmon, likely contributed to resilience. Most important were the beliefs and social institutions (including ownership, regulation, rituals, and monitoring) that placed restraints on salmon use as a common pool resource. In contrast, only a small fraction of our modern society relies economically on or has direct interaction with the fish, which limits our concern and willingness to fundamentally change behaviors that contribute to habitat degradation and loss, the main challenges facing salmon populations today. Salmon recovery efforts may benefit substantially from investing more resources into establishing links between community groups and actual fish populations, which would create a sense of proprietorship, one of the keys to resilience in the indigenous salmon fishery.]},

abstract = {Although point counts are frequently used in ornithological studies, basic as- sumptions about detection probabilities often are untested.We apply a double-observer ap- proach developed to estimate detection probabilities for aerial surveys (Cook and Jacobson 1979) to avian point counts. At each point count, a designated ‘‘primary'' observer indicates to another (‘‘secondary'') observer all birds detected. The secondary observer records all detections of the primary observer as well as any birds not detected by the primary observer. Observers alternate primary and secondary roles during the course of the survey. The ap- proach permits estimation of observer-specific detection probabilities and bird abundance. We developed a set of models that incorporate different assumptions about sources of var- iation (e.g. observer, bird species) in detection probability. Seventeen field trials were con- ducted, and models were fit to the resulting data using program SURVIV. Single-observer point counts generally miss varying proportions of the birds actually present, and observer and bird species were found to be relevant sources of variation in detection probabilities. Overall detection probabilities (probability of being detected by at least one of the two ob- servers) estimated using the double-observer approachwere very high (?0.95), yielding pre- cise estimates of avian abundance.We consider problems with the approach and recommend possible solutions, including restriction of the approach to fixed-radius counts to reduce the effect of variation in the effective radius of detection among various observers and to provide a basis for using spatial sampling to estimate bird abundance on large areas of interest.We believe that most questions meriting the effort required to carry out point counts also merit serious attempts to estimate detection probabilities associated with the counts. The double- observer approach is a method that can be used for this purpose. Received},

abstract = {Increasingly recreational fisheries are being managed as socioecological systems using spatially explicit and participatory place based approaches. Such approaches require considering the spatial dynamics of a resource (fish) as well as its users (anglers). While the former is comparatively well studied, very little empirical information exists regarding the spatial ranges of angler travel to fishing locations. To address this and ultimately inform spatial and place based management approaches, the statistical properties of angler travel were assessed in six popular marine recreational fisheries in Florida, USA. Expected angler travel distances differed among species, regions, and years, with most trips in certain fisheries (e.g., common snook) made by anglers residing in close proximity to the fishing site (< 30 km), while anglers targeting other species (e.g., red snapper) usually traveled more than 200 km from their residence to fish. In concert with literature, these results suggest that some fisheries may be better suited than others for more spatially explicit or place based approaches to management. More broadly, these results can be used to better identify and engage stakeholders in management, anticipate effects of spatially explicit management decisions, and assess relative importance of different fisheries for attracting out-of-region or state trips, which may be important for local economies.},

abstract = {Average reaction norms relating number of day-degrees required to complete egg development to temperature are described for 95 species (115 populations) of Plecoptera, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Diptera (mainly Culicidae, with some Tipulidae and Sciomyzidae). The slope of the average reaction norm is used as an index of adaptation, with positive slopes indicating cold-adapted species, negative slopes indicating warm-adapted species, and slopes around zero indicating generalist species; 57% of the between-taxon variation in slope is associated with differences between orders, 14% among families, 7% among genera, 14% among species, and 8% among populations. Significant differences between congeneric species are found in only 4 of 92 possible comparisons. Only Plecoptera show much cold-adaptation, with 40% of the species having significantly positive slope. However, 26% of the species (mainly in the Systellognatha) have significantly negative slope, suggesting adaptation to warmer waters than those in which the order is believed to have originated. The other orders probably originated in warm water and have generally maintained this adaptation. All Odonata, 71% of the Diptera and 81% of the Ephemeroptera have significantly negative slopes. Diapause is a common alternative to metabolic adaptation to deal with unfavourable thermal environments. We suggest that it occurs widely in eggs of Plecoptera and in the mayfly Rhithrogena loyolaea, cold-adapted species that may use diapause to survive periods of high temperature.\n},

The change in growth rate may be the result of differing allocation of energy between reproductive and somatic activities at different ages.

Demographic approaches can be used to improve our understanding of the dynamics of spatially structured populations and help identify subpopulations critical for the long-term persistence of regional metapopulations. We provide a regional metapopulation analysis to inform conservation management for Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in five subpopulations defined by land management designations. We used data from an individual-based mark–recapture study to estimate subpopulation sizes, subpopulation growth rates, and movement probabilities among subpopulations. We assessed the source–sink structure of the study population by calculating source–sink statistics, and we created a female-based matrix metapopulation model composed of all subpopulations to examine how variation in demographic components of survival, reproduction, and movement affected metapopulation growth rate. Movement data indicated no subpopulation was completely isolated, but movement probabilities varied among subpopulations. Source–sink statistics and net flow of individuals indicated three subpopulations were sources, while two subpopulations were sinks. We found areas with higher wildlife protection efforts and fewer anthropogenic impacts were sources, and less-protected areas were identified as sinks. Our results highlight the importance of identifying source–sink dynamics among subpopulations for effective conservation planning and emphasize how protected areas can play an important role in sustaining metapopulations.},

This knowledge base enables engineers to design infrastructure systems that contribute to productive, environmentally restorative, and socially desirable uses of land and protection of native flora and fauna. While ecosystems provide many invaluable services for humans and the environment, unsustainable activities affect the flows of energy within and among these ecosystems, causing loss or degradation of ecosystem services. Infrastructure can also indirectly affect ecosystems, by altering material and energy flows through a system or by damaging ecosystem function. The resulting damage can cause cascading impacts throughout an ecosystem.

abstract = {Abstract: The emerging world crisis created by declining fish stocks poses a challenge to resource users and managers. The problem is particularly acute in poor nations, such as those in East Africa, where fishing is an important subsistence activity but high fishing intensity and use of destructive gear have resulted in declining catches. In this context developing effective management strategies requires an understanding of how fishers may respond to declines in catch. We examined the readiness of 141 Kenyan fishers to stop fishing under hypothetical scenarios of declines in catch and how socioeconomic conditions influenced their decisions. As expected, the proportion of fishers that would exit the fishery increased with magnitude of decline in catch. Fishers were more likely to say they would stop fishing if they were from households that had a higher material style of life and a greater number of occupations. Variables such as capital investment in the fishery and the proportion of catch sold had weak, nonsignificant relationships. Our finding that fishers from poorer households would be less likely to exit a severely declining fishery is consistent with the literature on poverty traps, which suggests the poor are unable to mobilize the necessary resources to overcome either shocks or chronic low-income situations and consequently may remain in poverty. This finding supports the proposition that wealth generation and employment opportunities directed at the poorest fishers may help reduce fishing effort on overexploited fisheries, but successful interventions such as these will require an understanding of the socioeconomic context in which fishers operate.},

This has precluded a robust overview of the effect of climate change in the global ocean. Here, we synthesized all available studies of the consistency of marine ecological observations with expectations under climate change. This yielded a meta-database of 1,735 marine biological responses for which either regional or global climate change was considered as a driver. Included were instances of marine taxa responding as expected, in a manner inconsistent with expectations, and taxa demonstrating no response. From this database, 81-83% of all observations for distribution, phenology, community composition, abundance, demography and calcification across taxa and ocean basins were consistent with the expected impacts of climate change. Of the species responding to climate change, rates of distribution shifts were, on average, consistent with those required to track ocean surface temperature changes. Conversely, we did not find a relationship between regional shifts in spring phenology and the seasonality of temperature. Rates of observed shifts in species' distributions and phenology are comparable to, or greater, than those for terrestrial systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The degradation of habitats due to human activities is a major topic of interest for the conservation and management of wild populations. There is growing evidence that the Florida Everglades ecosystem continues to suffer from habitat degradation. After a period of recovery in the 1990s, the Snail Kite Rostrhamus sociabilis population suffered a substantial decline in 2001 and has not recovered since. Habitat degradation has been suggested as one of the primary reasons for this lack of recovery. As a consequence of the continued degradation of the Everglades, we hypothesized that this would have led to increased movement of juvenile Kites over time, as a consequence of the need to find more favourable habitat. We used multistate mark-recapture models to compare between-site movement probabilities of juvenile Snail Kites in the 1990s (1992-95; which corresponds to the period before the decline) and 2000s (2003-06; after the decline). Our analyses were based on an extensive radiotelemetry study (266 birds tracked monthly over the entire state of Florida for a total period of 6 years) and considered factors such as sex and age of marked individuals. There was evidence of increased movement of juvenile Snail Kites during the post-decline period from most of the wetland regions used historically by Kites. Higher movement rates may contribute to an increase in the probability of mortality of young individuals and could contribute to the observed declines. -{\textregistered} 2012 The Authors.

Human influences on marine ecosystems mediate changes in species interactions. This generality is evinced by the cascading effects of overharvesting top predators on the structure and function of marine ecosystems. It follows that ecological forecasting, ecosystem management, and marine spatial planning require a better understanding of food web relationships. Characterising and scaling predator-prey interactions for use in tactical and strategic tools (i.e. multi-species management and ecosystem models) are paramount in this effort. Here, we explore what issues are involved and must be considered to advance the use of predator-prey theory in the context of marine fisheries science. We address pertinent contemporary ecological issues including (1) the approaches and complexities of evaluating predator responses in marine systems; (2) the 'scaling up' of predator-prey interactions to the population, community, and ecosystem level; (3) the role of predator-prey theory in contemporary fisheries and ecosystem modelling approaches; and (4) directions for the future.

However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

abstract = {Independent experts and politicians have criticized statistical analyses of recreation behavior, which rely upon onsite samples due to their potential for biased inference. The use of onsite sampling usually reflects data or budgetary constraints, but can lead to two primary forms of bias in site choice models. First, the strategy entails sampling site choices rather than sampling individuals-a form of bias called endogenous stratification. Under these conditions, sample choices may not reflect the site choices of the true population. Second, exogenous attributes of the individuals sampled onsite may differ from the attributes of individuals in the population-the most common form in recreation demand is avidity bias. We propose addressing these biases by combining two the existing methods: Weighted Exogenous Stratification Maximum Likelihood estimation and propensity score estimation. We use the National Marine Fisheries Services Marine Recreational Fishing Statistics Survey to illustrate methods of bias reduction, employing both simulated and empirical applications. We find that propensity score based weights can significantly reduce bias in estimation. Our results indicate that failure to account for these biases can overstate anglerswillingness to pay for improvements in fishing catch, but weighted models exhibit higher variance of parameter estimates and willingness to pay. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration.

abstract = {Knowledge of offspring production (recruitment) is fundamental to understanding and forecasting the dynamics of a population. In this thesis, I focus on two demographic characteristics of fish stocks that are important to recruitment: population density and age structure. First, populations produce more recruits at low density, but quantifying this response has proven difficult. Using data from hundreds of populations of walleye (Sander vitreus ), an economically important freshwater fish, I demonstrate that the growing-degree-day metric (a temperature index) is better than age at explaining variation in density-dependent growth and maturity both within and among populations. I then incorporate multi-lake measures of density-dependent life history change into a temperature-based biphasic model of growth and reproduction to predict sustainable rates of mortality for walleye throughout most of their range. Second, the age (or size) structure of a population may also affect recruitment because of positive effects of maternal age on offspring production and survival; however, evidence for these 'maternal influences' on recruitment is limited. Using both an analytical model and a meta-analysis of stock-recruitment data from 25 species of exploited marine fish, I show that (i) maximum reproductive rate increased with the mean age of adults in a population, and (ii) the importance of age structure increased with a species' longevity. I then demonstrate a similar effect of maternal influences on reproductive rate in a detailed study of Lake Erie walleye. By highlighting the importance of fisheries-induced demographic change to recruitment, this thesis provides insight into past and present failures. However, it also demonstrates clearly the benefits of proactive management strategies that (i) identify and respect the limits of exploitation, (ii) protect from exploitation reproductively valuable individuals--principles that apply generally to any freshwater, marine, or terrestrial species that is of recreational, commercial, or conservation value.},

abstract = {Models that account for time-varying dynamics are increasingly used in population assessments in recognition of changing biological and environmental conditions. We performed a systematic simulation analysis based on a semelparous life history to evaluate the performance of various Ricker spawner-recruit models including stationary, random-walk, and regime shift models, that offer various interpretations of time-varying dynamics. Estimation models that allowed parameters to vary following random-walks tended to perform equally well or outperform regime shift and stationary models. However these results were not consistent across all scenarios examined. We also evaluated the performance of model selection criteria commonly used to identify time-varying processes. Both likelihood based model selection criteria (AICc and BIC) and cross-validation methods (LFO) were found to be unreliable, with a few exceptions. Changes in productivity were more identifiable than changes in capacity or both parameters, which were often indiscernible from stationary dynamics. The results were sensitive to the magnitude of parameter change and extent of residual variability (unexplained error), with greater changes and lower error being easier to accurately estimate and select. Given this context dependence for the accuracy of parameter estimates with time-varying models, and unreliable nature of selection criteria, we recommend that analysts conduct case-specific simulation-evaluations when model choices may have important and divergent management implications.},

abstract = {—We developed a linear discriminant function (LDF) using surface area, mean depth, fetch, and three substrate descriptors to discriminate the presence and absence of walleyes Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum) in 120 northern Wisconsin lakes. The resulting LDF correctly classified 90% of walleye lakes and 85% of nonwalleye lakes. For model validation, the model classified 90% of walleye lakes and 93% of nonwalleye lakes in an independent set of 100 randomly selected lakes. In contrast, within walleye lakes, an LDF using the same variables correctly clas-sified only 60% of 30 self-sustaining walleye lakes and 50% of 30 stocked walleye lakes. For model validation, the model classified 30% of self-sustaining walleye lakes and 73% of stocked walleye lakes in an independent set of 40 randomly selected lakes. To further assess the differences between walleye lakes with self-sustaining and stocked populations, the angler catch rates for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, smallmouth bass M. dolomieu, northern pike Esox lucius, and muskellunge E. masquinongy obtained from creel surveys during 1990–2001 were analyzed by means of a principal components analysis. The first principal component explained 29% of the variation and represented a linear contrast between the relative abundance of walleyes and mus-kellunge and the relative abundance of largemouth bass and northern pike. High largemouth bass and northern pike densities characterized lakes with stocked walleye populations, whereas high walleye and muskellunge densities characterized lakes with self-sustaining walleye populations. We conclude that physical features may be used to discriminate lakes where walleyes presently occur from lakes where walleyes do not presently occur, and that fish community differences exist between stocked and self-sustaining walleye populations in northern Wisconsin.},

abstract = {Conservation of marine biodiversity requires understanding the joint influence of ongoing environmental change and fishing pressure. Addressing this challenge requires robust biodiversity monitoring and analyses that jointly account for potential drivers of change. Here, we ask how demersal fish biodiversity in Canadian Pacific waters has changed since 2003 and assess the degree to which these changes can be explained by environmental change and commercial fishing. Using a spatiotemporal multispecies model based on fisheries independent data, we find that species density (number of species per area) and community biomass have increased during this period. Environmental changes during this period were associated with temporal fluctuations in the biomass of species and the community as a whole. However, environmental changes were less associated with changes in species occurrence. Thus, the estimated increases in species density are not likely to be due to environmental change. Instead, our results are consistent with an ongoing recovery of the demersal fish community from a reduction in commercial fishing intensity from historical levels. These findings provide key insight into the drivers of biodiversity change that can inform ecosystem-based management.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) and Quillback Rockfish (S. maliger) are important foods in the traditional diets of Indigenous people in coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada. These species are vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity increases with maternal size or age, yet large-scale fisheries truncate size and age structures. In BC's Central Coast, Indigenous fishers have observed declines in the size and abundance of rockfishes, particularly since the commercial over-exploitation that occurred in the late 1970s and 1980s. To address this conservation concern, we analyzed fishery-independent data collected annually since 2003 by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) and the Pacific Halibut Management Association (PHMA). These surveys are coast-wide, yet we focused on data for BC's Central Coast and vicinity. Linear mixed models tested for temporal trends in size and age while controlling for environmental variables. IPHC and PHMA surveys differed in field methodology and were analyzed separately. For Yelloweye Rockfish, fork length declined at average rates of −3.53 mm yr −1 (IPHC: 2003–2015) or −4.26 mm yr −1 (PHMA: 2006–2015), and age declined at average rates of −0.73 yrs yr −1 (IPHC: 2003–2012) or −0.86 yrs yr −1 (PHMA: 2006–2012). The fork length of Quillback Rockfish declined at an average rate of −4.57 mm yr −1 (PHMA: 2006–2015). Although rockfish management in BC has become more conservative since the early 2000s, the abundances of Yelloweye and Quillback Rockfish remain at historical low levels. Our results, along with the body of work that precedes them, suggest that loss of reproductive potential associated with size and age truncation could be hampering recovery. Current management criteria, however, are biomass-based and might fail to address this problem. Incorporating old age and large size structures into management objectives could enhance rockfish recovery and help maintain the cultural integrity of Indigenous people who rely on these species.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) emphasizes sustainability at multiple levels of organization beyond single target species. Therefore, biological reference points (BRPs) for aggregated groups are required, which optimize yields while preventing overexploitation of individual species. We evaluate the tradeoffs between yield and biodiversity objectives for a wide range of aggregation strategies using multispecies surplus production models and comparing 2 simulated fish communities. We simulated population trajectories with an operating model de - tailing predation and competitive interactions for all individual species within each community, and with additional stochastic environmental variability for one community. Species trajectories were then aggregated by functional feeding guild, taxonomy, habitat association, size class, and at the entire community level. We estimated production parameters and BRPs (e.g. maximum sustainable yield, MSY) using a simple assessment model applied to each aggregated time series, then we applied the MSY fishing rates to each simulated community as alternative fishing strategies and compared equilibrium biomass and yield under each strategy. We were able to define multi-species reference points to meet both yield and biodiversity objectives across full system, taxonomic, habitat, feeding, and size-based aggregations. Species complexes were best able to meet both objectives when species with broadly similar productivity, environmental sensitivity and species interactions were aggregated into the complex. The impacts of simulated environmental variability on BRPs were substantial for certain species and aggregates, so including the combined impacts of environmental variation and species interactions in precautionary reference points appears critical to EBFM. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research and Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012.},

By increasing our understanding of how genotype × environment interactions influence evolution, studies of genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity serve to refine our capacity to predict how populations will respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental variability, including climate change. Given the extraordinary variability in morphology, behaviour and life history in salmonids, one might anticipate the research milieu on reaction norms in these fishes to be empirically rich and intellectually engaging. Here, I undertake a review of genetic variability in continuous and discontinuous (threshold) norms of reaction in salmonid fishes, as determined primarily (but not exclusively) by common-garden experiments. Although in its infancy from a numerical publication perspective, there is taxonomically broad evidence of genetic differentiation in continuous, threshold and bivariate reaction norms among individuals, families and populations (including inter-population hybrids and backcrosses) for traits as divergent as embryonic development, age and size at maturity, and gene expression. There is compelling inferential evidence that plasticity is heritable and that population differences in reaction norms can reflect adaptive responses, by natural selection, to local environments. As a stimulus for future work, a series of 20 research questions are identified that focus on reaction-norm variability, selection, costs and constraints, demographic and conservation consequences, and genetic markers and correlates of phenotypic plasticity.},

@article{Cadrin2009,
abstract = {Stock identification has been an important prerequisite for stock assessment throughout its history. The earliest evaluations of recruitment variability recognized that understanding the spatial scale of a fishery resource is essential for studying population dynamics. A paradigm of stock structure was based on closed migration circuits and geographic variation of phenotypic traits and formed a premise for fishery modeling conventions in the mid-1900s. As genetic techniques developed in the late 1900s, the “stock concept” was refined to include a degree of reproductive isolation. Realization that there was no single method that addressed the various assumptions of stock assessment and needs of fishery management prompted a more holistic view of population structure that called for multiple sources of demographic and genetic data. Recent applications of advanced techniques challenge the traditional view of populations as geographically distinct units with homogeneous vital rates and isolation from adjacent resources. More complex concepts such as metapopulations and “contingent theory” may be more applicable to many fishery resources with sympatric population structure. These more complex patterns of population structure have been incorporated into some advanced stock assessment techniques and metapopulation models that account for movement among areas and sympatric heterogeneity. Wider application of spatially explicit models in future stock assessments will require clear identification of stock components, evaluating movement rates and determining the degree of reproductive isolation. Because spatial structure affects how populations respond to fisheries, incorporation of heterogeneous patterns and movement in stock assessment models should improve advice for fishery management.},

The mechanisms relating low-frequency environmental fluctuations (regime shifts) and their impacts on marine populations are not well established for most species, but there is an expectation that the accuracy of scientific advice provided to fisheries management would be improved if management strategies incorporated the effects of regime shifts on stocks. Management strategy evaluation is used to examine the impact of regime shifts in average recruitment on the performance of management strategies for the fishery for walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, in the Gulf of Alaska. The current and four alternative management strategies are evaluated. The alternatives include management strategies with different definitions of the average recruitment used when calculating management reference points, e.g., a 25-year sliding-window method and a "dynamic B0" method. The current management strategy, which ignores the possibility of future regime shifts, kept the spawning biomass higher relative to the target level than the other management strategies and had the lowest risk of fishing mortality exceeding the overfishing limit. The sliding-window management strategy achieved the highest catches and the lowest interannual variation in catch, although at the cost of a higher risk of the fishing mortality exceeding the overfishing limit.},

MSE models typically include a stock assessment component to estimate population size and management reference points based on data generated using the model, but including a full assessment within an MSE can be computationally intensive. A commonly used alternative to the full assessment approach is to simulate the error about the stock assessment outcomes as a stochastic process with an assumed level of autocorrelated estimation error. There is little guidance on what might be a reasonable assumed amount of autocorrelation, and what factors might influence this amount. We estimate the amount of temporal autocorrelation in errors of estimated biomass and recruitment from statistical catch at age stock assessment models over a series of scenarios spanning life histories, exploitation levels, recruitment variability, and data quality. Autocorrelation in the error in biomass estimates (. ϕ<inf>S</inf>) was positive and relatively high, with median estimates ranging between 0.7 and 0.9. Estimates were highest for the long-lived life history and lowest for the short-lived life history. Exploitation level also affected the amount of autocorrelation, with higher values for lightly exploited populations. On average, however, estimates of ϕ<inf>S</inf> did not change over time as more data were included in the assessment, and were independent of whether or not a harvest policy was applied. Recruitment variability and data quality had relatively minor effects on autocorrelation of errors.},

We analyzed 143 time series from 37 commercial fish stocks, the majority of which originated from the North Atlantic. Rates of phenotypic change were calculated for two traditional maturation indices (length and age at 50% maturity), as well as for probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). We found that all three indices declined in heavily exploited populations, and at a rate that was strongly correlated with the intensity of fishing (for length at 50% maturity and PMRNs). These results support previous assertions that fishing pressure is playing a major role in the life history changes observed in commercial fish stocks. Rates of change were as strong for PMRNs as for age and size at 50% maturity, which is consistent with the hypothesis that fishing-induced phenotypic changes can sometimes have a genetic basis.},

abstract = {While variation in age structure over time and space has long been considered important for population dynamics and conservation, reliable estimates of such spatio-temporal variation in age structure have been elusive for wild vertebrate populations. This limitation has arisen because of problems of imperfect detection, the potential for temporary emigration impacting assessments of age structure, and limited information on age. However, identifying patterns in age structure is important for making reliable predictions of both short- and long-term dynamics of populations of conservation concern. Using a multistate superpopulation estimator, we estimated region-specific abundance and age structure (the proportion of individuals within each age class) of a highly endangered population of snail kites for two separate regions in Florida over 17 years (1997–2013). We find that in the southern region of the snail kite—a region known to be critical for the long-term persistence of the species—the population has declined significantly since 1997, and during this time, it has increasingly become dominated by older snail kites (> 12 years old). In contrast, in the northern region—a region historically thought to serve primarily as drought refugia—the population has increased significantly since 2007 and age structure is more evenly distributed among age classes. Given that snail kites show senescence at approximately 13 years of age, where individuals suffer higher mortality rates and lower breeding rates, these results reveal an alarming trend for the southern region. Our work illustrates the importance of accounting for spatial structure when assessing changes in abundance and age distribution and the need for monitoring of age structure in imperiled species.},

abstract = {SUMMARY
How can the governance of environment and resources be devolved in a way that incorporates effective user participation and feedback learning? Approaches that use the idea of adaptive management or learning-by-doing, combined with co-management, are particularly promising. Using an interdisciplinary literature covering many types of resources, and a conceptual model with three phases (communicative action, self-organization and collective action), the paper identifies some of the major processes leading to adaptive co-management. These include deliberation, visioning, building social capital, trust and institutions, capacity-building through networks and partnerships, and action-reflection-action loops for social learning. Such adaptive co-management is not simply a theoretical possibility but something that has been documented in a number of forestry, fisheries, wildlife, protected area, and wetland cases from both developed and developing countries. However, the experience with the decentralization reforms of the 1990s is largely negative for a number of reasons. Effective devolution takes time, requiring a shift in focus from a static concept of management to a dynamic concept of governance shaped by interactions, feedback learning and adaptation over time. Sharing of governance responsibilities and an ability to learn from experience are among the emerging trends in environmental management.},

abstract = {We investigate the characteristics of an optimally managed spatially explicit renewable resource system. The bioeconomic system is depicted with a metapopulation model where the subpopulations are connected by dispersal processes and are affected by the spatial distribution of harvesting effort. We characterize the optimal way to distribute harvesting effort over space and time in order to optimize returns from this spatial/dynamic system. We also investigate how the optimal spatial allocation of effort, harvesting, and biomass compare with second-best allocations that ignore spatial processes in this system. We find that optimal instruments reflect the interplay between the spatial gradient of rents and the spatial gradient of biological dispersal. Using a simple parameterization to explore qualitative properties in several specific examples, we find that second-best solutions blend or average results of the differentiated case and differ in intuitive ways from first-best optima. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We collated smolt-to-adult return rate (SAR) data for Chinook salmon from all available regions of the Pacific coast of North America to examine the large-scale patterns of salmon survival. For consistency, our analyses primarily used coded wire tag-based (CWT) SAR estimates. Survival collapsed over the past half century by roughly a factor of three to ca. 1% for many regions. Within the Columbia River, the SARs of Snake River populations, often singled out as exemplars of poor survival, are unexceptional and in fact higher than estimates reported from many other regions of the west coast lacking dams. Given the seemingly congruent decline in SARs to similar levels, the notion that contemporary survival is driven primarily by broader oceanic factors rather than local factors should be considered. Ambitious Columbia River rebuilding targets may be unachievable because other regions with nearly pristine freshwater conditions, such as SE Alaska and northern BC, also largely fail to reach these levels. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag-based SAR estimates available for Columbia River Basin populations are generally consistent with CWT findings; however, PIT tag-based SARs are not adjusted for harvest which compromises their intended use because harvest rates are large and variable. More attention is needed on how SARs should be quantified and how rebuilding targets are defined. We call for a systematic review by funding agencies to assess consistency and comparability of the SAR data generated and to further assess the implications of survival falling to similar levels in most regions of the west coast.},

abstract = {A simple population model was developed to evaluate the role of plastic and evolutionary life-history changes on sustainable exploitation rates. Plastic changes are embodied in density-dependent compensatory adjustments to somatic growth rate and larval/juvenile survival, which can compensate for the reductions in reproductive lifetime and mean population fecundity that accompany the higher adult mortality imposed by exploitation. Evolutionary changes are embodied in the selective pressures that higher adult mortality imposes on age at maturity, length at maturity, and reproductive investment. Analytical development, based on a biphasic growth model, led to simple equations that show explicitly how sustainable exploitation rates are bounded by each of these effects. We show that density-dependent growth combined with a fixed length at maturity and fixed reproductive investment can support exploitation-driven mortality that is 80% of the level supported by evolutionary changes in maturation and reproductive investment. Sustainable fishing mortality is proportional to natural mortality (M) times the degree of density-dependent growth, as modified by both the degree of density-dependent early survival and the minimum harvestable length. We applied this model to estimate sustainable exploitation rates for North American walleye populations (Sander vitreus). Our analysis of demographic data from walleye populations spread across a broad latitudinal range indicates that density-dependent variation in growth rate can vary by a factor of 2. Implications of this growth response are generally consistent with empirical studies suggesting that optimal fishing mortality is approximately 0.75M for teleosts. This approach can be adapted to the management of other species, particularly when significant exploitation is imposed on many, widely distributed, but geographically isolated populations.},

The population structure is characterized in a manner consistent with modern biological ideas that stress patchiness, heterogeneity, and interconnections among and between patches. Generally, we find the equilibrium patterns of biomass and effort across the system to be dependent upon bioeconomic conditions within each patch and the nature of the biological dispersal mechanism between patches.

We analysed the spatial distribution of wolf (Canis lupus) predation on elk (Cervus elaphus) on the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park over 10 consecutive winters. The influence of wolf distribution on kill sites diminished over the course of this study, a result that was likely caused by territorial constraints on wolf distribution. In contrast, landscape factors strongly influenced kill sites, creating distinct hunting grounds and prey refugia. Elk in this newly restored predator-prey system should be able to mediate their risk of predation by movement and habitat selection across a heterogeneous risk landscape.},

abstract = {Recreational fisheries are often managed to provide satisfying fishing experiences for anglers while conserving wild fish stocks. However, managing recreational fisheries is difficult because fish populations are often infrequently monitored and fishing effort is uncontrolled; moreover, a satisfying fishery may draw many anglers, which may lead to enhanced risk of overfishing. Furthermore, external pressures will also affect fisheries, leading to fishery collapses despite the best intentions of management. Any management decision about regulations and habitat alteration will have effects on angler satisfaction and conservation. Decisions should be made with the intention of achieving fisheries objectives despite the uncertainties that arise from sampling data, ecosystem processes, and external factors, yet they must be defensible to stakeholders and the public. We show herein how decision analysis can be used to evaluate and communicate the relative efficacy of management decisions that are made to achieve fisheries management objectives by using a variety of commonly collected field data. We used a wild kokanee population at risk of overfishing as a case study and evaluated the medium-term effects of fishing regulations and habitat alterations on conservation and angler utility objectives. Using a flexible age-structured model, we determined that these two objectives are often at odds, where management actions leading to high angler utility in this fishery also lead to high conservation risk. Overall, decision analysis helps to communicate these tradeoffs and makes it clear how particular decisions were made. Decision analysis is not new, but it is often underused in recreational fisheries. This work demonstrates how it may streamline decisions, even for infrequently monitored fisheries, and lead to better fisheries overall.},

Fyke-net catch rates were modeled as a nonlinear function of adult walleye density and of four size-classes of the adult population, and electrofishing catch rates were modeled as a nonlinear function of adult and total walleye density and four size-classes of the adult and total populations. The results showed nonlinear relationships between catch rate and density for the adult and total populations. We accounted for measurement errors in catch rates and densities by estimating bias-corrected slopes by means of Monte Carlo simulations and estimated measurement-error ratios by means of an errors-in-variables model. We found that the bias-corrected slopes were higher than ordinary-least-squares regression estimates and that measurement errors were greater in catch rates than in density estimates. Lastly, we sought to explain the residual variability in the relationships between (1) fyke-net catch rates and adult walleye densities and (2) electrofishing catch rates and adult and total walleye densities. We found that the fyke-net catch rate was positively related to adult walleye density and percent littoral zone (percentage of lake surface area ≤20 ft deep) and negatively related to conductivity. We found that the electrofishing catch rate of adult walleyes was positively related to adult walleye density and conductivity and that the electrofishing catch rate of the total walleye population was positively related to total walleye density. We concluded that the nonlinear relationship between catch rates and walleye abundance limits the use of catch rates to index walleye abundance in northern Wisconsin lakes.},

abstract = {Climate-driven changes in the oceans, such as shifts in prey timing and abundance, could influence variability in population productivity of marine fishes. For example, according to the match/mismatch hypothesis, the temporal matching of the young salmon outmigration from freshwater to the ocean relative to the timing of availability of their prey could influence their marine survival. Indeed, understanding patterns and processes of marine survival is particularly pressing in many salmon and steelhead trout populations due to recent declines. To determine whether phenological mismatches between juvenile salmonids and their prey could contribute to low ocean survival, we analyzed the migration timing and ocean survival of 22,116 tagged juvenile steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss over 12 years from the Wind River, Washington State, USA. We used a Bayesian multilevel modelling approach with variable selection to assess how survival was associated with body size, river exit date, the biological spring transition date (the day when northern zooplankton first appeared in the coastal region near the Columbia River estuary), and the degree of mismatch (the effect of the interaction between individual outmigration timing and biological spring transition date). The variables with the highest probability of contributing to individual survival were fish size (100%), river exit date (99%), the interaction between year and river exit date (91%), and the biological spring transition date (64%). Fish that were larger than average at outmigration had higher ocean survival, providing further evidence that freshwater growing conditions have carryover effects on marine survival. Years with greater annual phenological mismatches such as those years with late biological spring transition dates (i.e., occurring after June 1st), or warm sea surface temperatures, had sufficiently low marine survival to compromise recovery goals. Substantial intra-annual variation in outmigration timing buffered the population from inter-annual variation in optimal outmigration timing. Collectively these findings indicate that freshwater growing conditions, migration timing, and the timing of high-quality food availability in the nearshore coastal environment work in concert to influence individual survival and annual smolt-to-adult returns.},

Two benchmarks will be used to place populations in one of three abundance categories. The lower benchmark is proposed to be at a level that allows for a substantial buffer between it and the abundance that would result in a population's being assessed as at risk of extirpation based on quantitative criteria used by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we evaluated eight candidate lower benchmarks calculated from parameters of the stock–recruit relationship against two criteria, the probability of extirpation over 100 years and the probability of recovery to spawner abundances that result in the maximum sustainable yield in one or three generations. For modeled populations of moderate size (unfished equilibrium abundances >25,000) and moderate productivity (∼four adult recruits produced per spawner at low spawner abundances), all benchmarks protected populations from extirpation when harvest restrictions were imposed at the lower benchmark. For small or unproductive populations, none of the benchmarks was adequate to prevent populations from being at risk of extirpation. However, those benchmarks that covaried with the productivity parameter of the stock–recruitment relationship performed better and are preferred to those that were derived mainly from estimates of habitat capacity. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2011.},

We used a stated-preference choice model of British Columbia, Canada, anglers to predict their behavioral intentions to fish at lakes described by catch-related and non-catch-related attributes, such as expected catch and travel distance. We investigated how different means of accounting for preference heterogeneity and decision context affected conclusions about angler preferences for fishing sites. Our preferred model of fishing site choice accounted for both observable and unobservable (to the researcher) preference heterogeneity for site attributes, angler characteristics (i.e., recreation specialization and residence), and context (i.e., trip duration and target species). On average, anglers' preferences conformed to expectations, but preferences for different site attributes varied greatly among anglers and contexts. For example, highly specialized anglers were more influenced by catch rates, fish size, and bag limits and were less deterred by travel than were less-specialized anglers. Anglers facing multiple-day trip contexts were influenced more by fish size and bag limits than were anglers considering day fishing trips. This latter result is especially important, as researchers often estimate models of angler behaviors by excluding anglers that undertake multiple-day trips, who might be the most sensitive to changes in regulations and fishing quality characteristics.},

abstract = {Spatially synchronized fluctuations in system state are common in physical and biological systems ranging from individual atoms to species as diverse as viruses, insects and mammals. Although the causal factors are well known for many synchronized phenomena, several processes concurrently have an impact on spatial synchrony of species, making their separate effects and interactions difficult to quantify. Here we develop a general stochastic model of predator-prey spatial dynamics to predict the outcome of a laboratory microcosm experiment testing for interactions among all known synchronizing factors: (1) dispersal of individuals between populations; (2) spatially synchronous fluctuations in exogenous environmental factors (the Moran effect); and (3) interactions with other species (for example, predators) that are themselves spatially synchronized. The Moran effect synchronized populations of the ciliate protist Tetrahymena pyriformis; however, dispersal only synchronized prey populations in the presence of the predator Euplotes patella. Both model and data indicate that synchrony depends on cyclic dynamics generated by the predator. Dispersal, but not the Moran effect, 'phase-locks' cycles, which otherwise become 'decoherent' and drift out of phase. In the absence of cycles, phase-locking is not possible and the synchronizing effect of dispersal is negligible. Interspecific interactions determine population synchrony, not by providing an additional source of synchronized fluctuations, but by altering population dynamics and thereby enhancing the action of dispersal. Our results are robust to wide variation in model parameters representative of many natural predator-prey or host-pathogen systems. This explains why cyclic systems provide many of the most dramatic examples of spatial synchrony in nature.},

abstract = {Natal homing is a hallmark of the life history of salmonid fishes, but the spatial scale of homing within local, naturally reproducing salmon populations is still poorly understood. Accurate homing (paired with restricted movement) should lead to the existence of fine-scale genetic structuring due to the spatial clustering of related individuals on spawning grounds. Thus, we explored the spatial resolution of natal homing using genetic associations among individual Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in an interconnected stream network. We also investigated the relationship between genetic patterns and two factors hypothesized to influence natal homing and localized movements at finer scales in this species, localized patterns in the distribution of spawning gravels and sex. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that spawning locations in both sub-basins of our study site were spatially clumped, but the upper sub-basin generally had a larger spatial extent and continuity of redd locations than the lower sub-basin, where the distribution of redds and associated habitat conditions were more patchy. Male genotypes were not autocorrelated at any spatial scale in either sub-basin. Female genotypes showed significant spatial autocorrelation and genetic patterns for females varied in the direction predicted between the two sub-basins, with much stronger autocorrelation in the sub-basin with less continuity in spawning gravels. The patterns observed here support predictions about differential constraints and breeding tactics between the two sexes and the potential for fine-scale habitat structure to influence the precision of natal homing and localized movements of individual Chinook salmon on their breeding grounds.},

abstract = {Fisheries management operates in an environment characterized by multiple risks. These risks are often complementary and can be traded off against each other. An important goal for managers is to develop strategies to minimize the overall risk exposure at minimal cost. We show a simple model that quantifies a range of risks faced by fisheries management agencies in terms of long-term expected budgetary expenditure. The model includes not only the cost a management agency would be expected to incur from overfishing a stock, or from being seen to overfish it, but also the social cost incurred fromnot achieving its objectives, such as the opportunity cost of foregoing catches and economic returns. These costs can be controlled by adjusting the biomass level targeted by management, or increasing expenditures for data collection to improve the precision of biomass estimates. The overall risk, expressed as the long-term total expected cost to a management agency, depends strongly on the fisheries management objectives, and the emphasis on conservation or economic motives. In general, management under a conservation-oriented objective would reduce risk either by increasing target biomass levels or by expenditure on monitoring and assessment, while a catch-focused objective would seek to lowermanagement costs by reducing expenditure on datacollection and assessment. Increased natural stock variability affects the risk of overfishing, and long-term expected costs as the ability to make a meaningful estimate of biomass declines. Management of catchfocused fisheries would reduce the biomass target as stock variability increases, because the benefit of catches are seen to outweigh the cost, or risk of being overfished. The model provides the basis for more extensive risk analyses, and serves as a simple lesson that the consequences of reducing the short-term costs associated with managing a fishery can come with a concomitant increase in overall risk.},

abstract = {The degradation of habitats due to human activities is a major topic of interest for the conservation and management of wild populations. There is growing evidence that the Florida Everglades ecosystem continues to suffer from habitat degradation. After a period of recovery in the 1990s, the Snail Kite Rostrhamus sociabilis population suffered a substantial decline in 2001 and has not recovered since. Habitat degradation has been suggested as one of the primary reasons for this lack of recovery. As a consequence of the continued degradation of the Everglades, we hypothesized that this would have led to increased movement of juvenile Kites over time, as a consequence of the need to find more favourable habitat. We used multistate mark-recapture models to compare between-site movement probabilities of juvenile Snail Kites in the 1990s (1992-95; which corresponds to the period before the decline) and 2000s (2003-06; after the decline). Our analyses were based on an extensive radiotelemetry study (266 birds tracked monthly over the entire state of Florida for a total period of 6 years) and considered factors such as sex and age of marked individuals. There was evidence of increased movement of juvenile Snail Kites during the post-decline period from most of the wetland regions used historically by Kites. Higher movement rates may contribute to an increase in the probability of mortality of young individuals and could contribute to the observed declines. -{\textregistered} 2012 The Authors.

Abstract A considerable amount of research has investigated the influence of habitat structure on pred-ator success, yet few studies have explored the implica-tions for community structure and food-web dynamics. The relative importance of macrophyte structure and fish predation on the composition of the macroinverte-brate and periphyton communities in a lowland river was investigated using a multifactorial caging experi-ment. We hypothesised that: (1) fish predators are less effective in a more structurally complex macrophyte analogue; (2) strong direct and indirect effects of fish predators (e.g. trophic cascades) are less likely to occur in a structurally complex habitat; and (3) the strength of these patterns is influenced by the composition of the prevailing community assemblage. We measured the abundance and composition of the macroinverte-brate and periphyton communities associated with three different-shaped macrophyte analogues, under different fish predator treatments and at different times. Macrophyte analogue architecture had strong, consistent effects on both the macroinvertebrate and periphyton communities; both were most abundant and diverse on the most structurally complex plant analogue. In contrast, the fish predators affected only a subset of the macroinvertebrate community and there was a suggestion of minor indirect effects on periphy-ton community composition. Contrary to expectations, the fish predators had their strongest effects in the most structurally complex macrophyte analogue. We con-clude that in this system, macrophyte shape strongly regulates the associated freshwater assemblage, result-ing in a diverse community structure less likely to exhibit strong effects of fish predation.},

abstract = {1. Differences in energy use between genders is a probable mechanism underlying sexual size dimorphism (SSD), but testing this hypothesis in the field has proven difficult. We evaluated this mechanism as an explanation for SSD in two North American percid species--walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens. 2. Data from 47 walleye and 67 yellow perch populations indicated that SSD is associated with the onset of maturation: typically, males of both species matured smaller and earlier and attained a smaller asymptotic size than females. Males also demonstrated equal (perch) or longer (walleye) reproductive life spans compared with females. 3. To examine whether reduced post-maturation growth in males was due to lower energy acquisition or higher reproductive costs we applied a contaminant mass-balance model combined with a bioenergetics model to estimate metabolic costs and food consumption of each sex. Mature males exhibited lower food consumption, metabolic costs and food conversion efficiencies compared with females. 4. We propose that slower growth in males at the onset of maturity is a result of decreased feeding activity to reduce predation risk. Our finding that SSD in percids is associated with the onset of maturity is supported by laboratory-based observations reported elsewhere, showing that changes in growth rate, consumption and food conversion efficiency were elicited by oestrogen (positive effects) or androgen (negative effects) exposure in P. flavescens and P. fluviatilis. 5. Researchers applying bioenergetic models for comparative studies across populations should use caution in applying bioenergetic models in the absence of information on population sex ratio and potential differences between the sexes in energetic parameters.},

abstract = {To understand the processes that regulate the abundance and persistence of wild populations is a fundamental goal of ecology and a prerequisite for the management of living resources. Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging. A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated is the possibility that the pattern of variability--its strength as a function of population size--may be more than 'noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density-dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, populations of rockfish Sebastes spp. off the U.S. West Coast have declined sharply, leading to heightened concern about the sustainability of current harvest policies for these populations. In this paper, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to jointly estimate the stockrecruit relationships of rockfish stocks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Stockrecruit curves for individual stocks are linked using a prior distribution for the ‘‘steepness'' parameter of the Beverton–Holt stockrecruit curve, defined as the expected recruitment at 20% of unfished biomass relative to unfished recruitment. The choice of a spawning biomass per recruit (SPR) harvest rate is considered a problem in decision theory, in which different options are evaluated in the presence of uncertainty in the stockrecruit relationship. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to obtain the marginal distributions of variables of interest to management, such as the yield at a given SPR rate. A wide range of expected yield curves were obtained for different rockfish stocks. The stocks of Pacific ocean perch S. alutus in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are apparently the most resilient, with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) harvest rates greater than F30% (the fishing mortality rate that reduces SPR to 30% of its unfished value) for all model configurations. In contrast, the MSY harvest rate for the West Coast stock of Pacific ocean perch was lower than F70%. The SPR rates at MSY for other stocks were clustered between F40% and F60% and depended on both the stockrecruit model (Beverton–Holt or Ricker) and the model for recruitment variability (lognormal or gamma). Meta-analysis results should be interpreted cautiously due to autocorrelation in the model residuals for several stocks and the potential confounding effect of decadal variation in ecosystem productivity. An F40% harvest rate, the current default harvest rate for rockfish, exceeded the estimated FMSY rate for all West Coast rockfish stocks with the exception of black rockfish S. melanops. A harvest rate of F50% is suggested as a risk-neutral FMSY proxy for rockfish. A more risk-averse alternative would be to apply an SPR harvest rate in the F55%F60% range.},

abstract = {Growing scientific awareness, strong regulations, and effective management have begun to fulfill the promise of recovery in the ocean. However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.},

abstract = {Understanding dispersal and habitat selection behaviours is central to many problems in ecology, evolution and conservation. One factor often hypothesized to influence habitat selection by dispersers is the natal environment experienced by juveniles. Nonetheless, evidence for the effect of natal environment on dispersing, wild vertebrates remains limited. Using 18 years of nesting and mark-resight data across an entire North American geographical range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), we tested for natal effects on breeding-site selection by dispersers and its consequences for reproductive success and population structure. Dispersing snail kites were more likely to nest in wetlands of the same habitat type (lacustrine or palustrine) as their natal wetland, independent of dispersal distance, but this preference declined with age and if individuals were born during droughts. Importantly, dispersing kites that bred in natal-like habitats had lower nest success and productivity than kites that did not. These behaviours help explain recently described population connectivity and spatial structure across their geographical range and reveal that assortative breeding is occurring, where birds are more likely to breed with individuals born in the same wetland type as their natal habitat. Natal environments can thus have long-term and large-scale effects on populations in nature, even in highly mobile animals.},

abstract = {Models of species' demographic features are commonly used to understand population dynamics and inform management tactics. Hierarchical demographic models are ideal for the assessment of non-indigenous species because our knowledge of non-indigenous populations is usually limited, data on demographic traits often come from a species' native range, these traits vary among populations, and traits are likely to vary considerably over time as species adapt to new environments. Hierarchical models readily incorporate this spatiotemporal variation in species' demographic traits by representing demographic parameters as multi-level hierarchies. As is done for traditional non-hierarchical matrix models, sensitivity and elasticity analyses are used to evaluate the contributions of different life stages and parameters to estimates of population growth rate. We applied a hierarchical model to northern snakehead (Channa argus), a fish currently invading the eastern United States. We used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate uncertainties in the sensitivity and elasticity analyses and to project future population persistence under selected management tactics. We gathered key biological information on northern snakehead natural mortality, maturity and recruitment in its native Asian environment. We compared the model performance with and without hierarchy of parameters. Our results suggest that ignoring the hierarchy of parameters in demographic models may result in poor estimates of population size and growth and may lead to erroneous management advice. In our case, the hierarchy used multi-level distributions to simulate the heterogeneity of demographic parameters across different locations or situations. The probability that the northern snakehead population will increase and harm the native fauna is considerable. Our elasticity and prognostic analyses showed that intensive control efforts immediately prior to spawning and/or juvenile-dispersal periods would be more effective (and probably require less effort) than year-round control efforts. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering the hierarchy of parameters in estimating population growth rate and evaluating different management strategies for non-indigenous invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In fisheries ecology and stock assessment, recruitment signifies the transition from early stages of the life cycle which are characterized by environmentally-driven variability and density-dependence in mortality rates, to a recruited phase when natural mortality is largely stable and density-independent. Age or size at recruitment is an important structural element of age-structured fisheries models and stock assessment methods, yet the choice is often somewhat arbitrary and little guidance exists for when, biologically, a fish can be considered recruited. Such models may be mis-specified when recruitment is assumed to occur too early, i.e. when ‘recruited' fish are still subject to density-dependent mortality even though the model specifies that they are not. We synthesize empirical data on density-dependence in mortality at different life stages within wild, stocked, cultured and experimentally manipulated fish populations. Results suggest the existence of a broad, approximately invariant pattern of density dependence across a wide range of fish life histories. Density-dependent mortality is most likely to occur, and potentially strongest, while fish are smaller than 10% of population asymptotic lengthy L∞. Both the likelihood of encountering density-dependent mortality and its potential strength are far more moderate for fish between 10 and 20% of L∞, and diminish in fish larger than 20% of L∞. This result provides the first empirically-based guidance for determining an appropriate size or age at recruitment for stock assessments. The result also provides information relevant to other fisheries management issues, such as the design and evaluation of fish stocking programs.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services for millions of people in the tropics, but reef conditions are declining worldwide. Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized. Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs ("gravity"), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high. Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low. Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves. However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low. Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.},

During the summer of 1994, we investigated whether such abiotic heterogeneity influenced epiphytic midge larvae (Diptera:Chironomidae) inhabiting a stand of Scirpus americanus in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. After macrophytes became well established, gradients in six parameters of water quality (turbidity, alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and chloride) formed horizontally from the macrophyte edge towards the shore. In outer portions of the stand where physico-chemical properties were influenced by the influx of pelagic surface waves? chironomid abundance increased to 1076 larvae.stem(-1). Diversity (H') in these areas remained constant over the summer with grazing and filter-feeding taxa equally represented. Further into the macrophyte bed where water quality indicated highly reduced mixing, midge abundance never exceeded 27 individuals.stem(-1) and larval biomass was reduced 2-4 fold. Loss of filter-feeding taxa resulted in a dramatic decline in diversity in these areas after formation of the abiotic gradients. This study suggests that pelagic-littoral water exchange may result in environmental heterogeneity that directly or indirectly influences epiphytic invertebrate community structure and function.},

abstract = {Marine social-ecological systems are constantly changing, and fishers who make a living from working the seas are continually adapting in response to different sources of variability. One main way in which fishers can adapt to ecosystem change is to change the fisheries they participate in. This acts to connect fisheries, creating interlinked networks of alternative sources of income for fishers. Here, we synthesize fisheries data and construct fisheries connectivity networks for all major ports in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Fisheries connectivity networks are comprised of nodes, which are fisheries, connected by edges, whose weights are proportional to the number of participating vessels. Fisheries connectivity networks identify central fisheries in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, specifically Dungeness crab and Spiny Lobster, and systematic topological differences, e.g. in network resilience and modularity. These network metrics directly relate to the social vulnerability of coastal fishing communities, especially their sensitivity and capacity to adapt to perturbation. Ultimately, improving knowledge of fisheries connectivity is vital if policy makers are to create governance institutions that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental, technological and management change while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries. In doing so, new policies that account for fisheries connectivity, will lead to improved sustainable fisheries management, and enhanced socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities.},

abstract = {Abstract

Balancing trade‐offs amongst social–ecological objectives is a central aim of natural resource management. However, objectives and resources often have spatial dimensions, which are usually ignored in trade‐off analyses. We examine how simultaneously integrating social–ecological benefits and their spatial complexities can improve trade‐off analysis. We use Pacific herring (
Clupea pallasii,
Clupeidae)—an ecologically important forage fish with social, cultural and economic value to communities and commercial fisheries—as a case study. By combining spatial management strategy evaluation with social benefits analysis, we illustrate when policies aimed at aggregate stocks versus spatially segregated substocks of fish fail to balance trade‐offs amongst social–ecological objectives. Spatial measures (e.g. area‐based closures) may achieve some objectives but produce alternative trade‐offs that are sensitive to assumptions about fish population dynamics and social complexities. Our analyses identify policies that are inefficient (e.g. yielding economic costs without producing social or ecological gains), highlight management strategies that generate trade‐offs and indicate when costs are distributed unequally for different user groups. We also point to strategies with outcomes that are robust to spatial uncertainties and reveal research priorities by identifying which performance metrics exhibit sensitivity to spatial ecological assumptions. Collectively, our analyses demonstrate how incorporating social objectives and spatial dynamics into management strategy evaluation can reveal trade‐offs and the implications of management decisions.},

Dilbit is an unresolved complex mixture with variable diluent and bitumen composition. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of the two most transported dilbits in Canada, Access Western Blend (AWB) and Cold Lake Blend (CLB) on a North America native and freshwater fish species, the yellow perch (Perca flavescens). Fertilized embryos were exposed to both dilbits for 16 days, from <24 h post-fertilization until hatch. The treatment regime was a static daily renewal of water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically-enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAF) at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 21.3 $\mu$g/L of total polycyclic aromatic compounds (TPACs). Hatched embryos were assessed for malformations and changes in the expression of genes associated with phase I and II detoxification and oxidative stress. The prevalence of developmental malformations increased significantly at the highest concentrations of all treatments, with WAF treatments yielding a higher prevalence than CEWAF. The EC50s for AWB and CLB WAF and CEWAF solutions ranged from 9.8 to 24 $\mu$g/L TPACs, with the CEWAF of AWB being the least toxic. Relative mRNA levels of cyp1a showed induction by up to 18-fold in WAF and 50-fold in CEWAF treatments at similar concentrations of measured dilbit in solution. Complementary DNA methylation analysis was assessed and fish embryos exposed to AWB CEWAF and CLB WAF showed decreased DNA methylation profiles with increasing exposure to dilbit, suggesting that global gene expression is increasing in these treatments. With recent approvals of pipelines in North America, these data will support site-specific risk assessments and monitoring of Canadian ecosystems should a pipeline spill occur.},

abstract = {Objective: Our aim was to predict the maturity (will spawn or immature) of Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria in Alaska for past years during a period when macroscopic data are not of utility and histological observations are not available. Methods: In a previous study, female maturity was determined using histology and a model was developed that predicted maturity using maternal length, age, and relative condition. We used this published model to predict the maturity of individual Sablefish collected annually in the same area on the same dates. The maturity predictions were used to create predicted time series of maturity at age for surveys conducted over 22 years. Result: A k-means cluster analysis of annual maturity parameters revealed that data should be split into two clusters. These groups were chronologically sequential (1998–2010 and 2011–2019), with two exceptions: 2015 and 2017 were assigned to the early time period. We created two chronological time blocks by incorporating the two outlier years into the late period post hoc, as we are not aware of mechanisms that may have caused these two outliers, and it is important for stock assessment to capture the signal and not the noise. Sablefish in the later period were predicted to mature later than fish in the earlier period; age at 50% maturity was 5.5 years in the early period and 6.8 years in the later period, and the slope was shallower in the later period. Conclusion: There are often gaps in reliable maturity data. This case study illustrates that limited histological data sets can be used to predict maturity in years without ovary samples and illustrates how these data can be grouped based on similarities and chronology for use in stock assessment. We recommend more histological studies in the future to test assumptions of the predictive model, and we recommend evaluations of other factors, such as environmental time series, that may be drivers of annual maturity.},

abstract = {Here we review the population, community, and evolutionary consequences of marine reserves. Responses at each level depend on the tendency of fisheries to target larger body sizes and the tendency for greater reserve protection with less movement within and across populations. The primary population response to reserves is survival to greater ages and sizes plus increases in the population size for harvested species, with greater response to reserves that are large relative to species' movement rates. The primary community response to reserves is an increase in total biomass and diversity, with the potential for trophic cascades and altered spatial patterning of metacommunities. The primary evolutionary response to reserves is increased genetic diversity, with the theoretical potential for protection against fisheries-induced evolution and selection for reduced movement. The potential for the combined outcome of these responses to buffer marine populations and communities against temporal environmental heterogeneity has preliminary theoretical and empirical support.},

abstract = {Human-induced trait change has been documented in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These trait changes are driven by phenotypic plasticity and contemporary evolution. While efforts to manage human-induced trait change are beginning to receive some attention, managing its ecological consequences has received virtually none. Recent work suggests that contemporary trait change can have important effects on the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Therefore, trait changes caused by human activity may be shaping ecological dynamics on a global scale. We present evidence for important ecological effects associated with human-induced trait change in a variety of study systems. These effects can occur over large spatial scales and impact system-wide processes such as trophic cascades. Importantly, the magnitude of these effects can be on par with those of traditional ecological drivers such as species presence. However, phenotypic change is not always an agent of ecological change; it can also buffer ecosystems against change. Determining the conditions under which phenotypic change may promote vs prevent ecological change should be a top research priority.},

abstract = {The number of protected areas that restrict or prohibit harvest of wild populations is growing. In general, protected areas are expected to increase the abundance of previously-harvested species. Whether a protected area achieves this expectation is typically evaluated by assessing trends in abundance after implementation. However, the underlying assumption that harvest has actually ceased is rarely tested directly. Determining whether illegal harvest (poaching) has continued in a protected area is important to planning enforcement and adaptive management. Here, we estimated harvest rates for four kelp forest fish species inside marine protected areas (MPAs) and non-MPA reference sites in the California Channel Islands, from 2003 (when MPAs were implemented) to 2017. We estimated harvest by fitting a size-structured population model to survey data. Overall, harvest rates were effectively zero in MPAs but much higher in non-MPA sites. This indicates successful adherence to MPA regulations, and possible displacement of fishing effort to reference sites. However, some poaching was detected in two MPA sites, highlighting the importance of assessing this quantity. This modeling approach could provide a tool to complement the long-term management of MPA networks, particularly given the difficulty of acquiring harvest rate data at the spatial scale of individual MPAs.},

This was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the number of populations and a 10-fold increase in the habitat area occupied. The improving status of H. comma is the product of good habitat management, recovering rabbit populations and climate warming, which have improved the quality, and increased the availability, of suitable habitat. This has enabled remnant metapopulations to expand, via distance-dependent colonisation, through large networks of habitat. Metapopulation recovery in H. comma demonstrates that landscape-scale conservation can be successful. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These monitoring programs have been successful in assessing recovery from oil spill impacts, and their continuation decades later has now provided an unparalleled assessment of ecosystem responses to another newly emerging global threat, marine heatwaves. The 2014–2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) in the Gulf of Alaska was the longest lasting heatwave globally over the past decade, with some cooling, but also continued warm conditions through 2019. Our analysis of 187 time series from primary production to commercial fisheries and nearshore intertidal to offshore oceanic domains demonstrate abrupt changes across trophic levels, with many responses persisting up to at least 5 years after the onset of the heatwave. Furthermore, our suite of metrics showed novel community-level groupings relative to at least a decade prior to the heatwave. Given anticipated increases in marine heatwaves under current climate projections, it remains uncertain when or if the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH state.},

abstract = {There is little doubt that estuarine habitat is important for some exploited fish species, at some times, and in some places. However, it is also clear that we do not have enough resources to conserve or restore all estuarine habitat. Consequently, a simple, quantitative and transparent approach to prioritizing estuarine habitat management is required. Here, we present a general framework for identifying critical habitats of exploited fishes. Our approach requires three basic steps: (1) develop stage-structured models and identify sensitive life history stages; (2) determine what habitats, if any, are important to these stages; and (3) identify sites in which high densities of critical life stages occur in important habitat. We will illustrate the utility of this approach using red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus. Results of a simulation-based sensitivity analysis of a stage-structured matrix model show that most of the variability in population growth rate ($\lambda$) of red drum is explained by larval and juvenile survival rates. Thus, this approach indicates that larval/juvenile red drum habitat should be given higher priority for conservation and/or restoration than habitats used by other life history stages. To illustrate the potential importance of juvenile habitat to red drum, we modeled the growth of a hypothetical red drum population using different population matrices as manifestations of varying habitat conditions. These numerical experiments revealed that restoration of both marsh and seagrass habitats would yield a ca. 24% increase in post-settlement survival and would result in a ca. 2% increase in $\lambda$ - an increase sufficient to stem a long-term population decline. Our results illustrate that protection of fish habitat depends not only on protecting sites where fish occur but also on protecting the ecological processes that allow populations to expand. Quantitative and synthetic analyses of ecological data are a first step in this direction. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many free-ranging predators have to make foraging decisions with little, if any, knowledge of present resource distribution and availability. The optimal search strategy they should use to maximize encounter rates with prey in heterogeneous natural environments remains a largely unresolved issue in ecology. L{\'{e}}vy walks are specialized random walks giving rise to fractal movement trajectories that may represent an optimal solution for searching complex landscapes. However, the adaptive significance of this putative strategy in response to natural prey distributions remains untested. Here we analyse over a million movement displacements recorded from animal-attached electronic tags to show that diverse marine predators-sharks, bony fishes, sea turtles and penguins-exhibit L{\'{e}}vy-walk-like behaviour close to a theoretical optimum. Prey density distributions also display L{\'{e}}vy-like fractal patterns, suggesting response movements by predators to prey distributions. Simulations show that predators have higher encounter rates when adopting L{\'{e}}vy-type foraging in natural-like prey fields compared with purely random landscapes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that observed search patterns are adapted to observed statistical patterns of the landscape. This may explain why L{\'{e}}vy-like behaviour seems to be widespread among diverse organisms, from microbes to humans, as a 'rule' that evolved in response to patchy resource distributions.},

abstract = {Recent marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Alaska have had devastating impacts on species from various trophic levels. Due to climate change, total heat exposure in the upper ocean has become longer, more intense, more frequent, and more likely to happen at the same time as other environmental extremes. The combination of multiple environmental extremes can exacerbate the response of sensitive marine organisms. Our hindcast simulation provides the first indication that more than 20% of the bottom water of the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf was exposed to quadruple heat, positive hydrogen ion concentration [H+], negative aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$arag), and negative oxygen concentration [O2] compound extreme events during the 2018–2020 marine heat wave. Natural intrusion of deep and acidified water combined with the marine heat wave triggered the first occurrence of these events in 2019. During the 2013–2016 marine heat wave, surface waters were already exposed to widespread marine heat and positive [H+] compound extreme events due to the temperature effect on the [H+]. We introduce a new Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index (GOADI) with short-term predictive skill, which can serve as indicator of past and near-future positive [H+], negative $\Omega$arag, and negative [O2] compound extreme events near the shelf seafloor. Our results suggest that the marine heat waves may have not been the sole environmental stressor that led to the observed ecosystem impacts and warrant a closer look at existing in situ inorganic carbon and other environmental data in combination with biological observations and model output.},

abstract = {In the model described, we attempt to link breeding-site selection to population dynamics for situations in which there is more than one distinct type of habitat. The distribution of individuals between habitat types depends on the selective abilities of the species. This distribution, in turn, influences the population dynamics of the species as a whole. We show that the consequences of habitat selection on population dynamics for an ideal free distribution of individuals across habitats is predictably different from what would be predicted if habitat selection were preemptive, that is, if individuals, upon selecting a site, prevented others from sharing the site. If preemptive selection is ideal, average reproductive success declines with increasing density because each individual selects the best site available from those sites not yet occupied. The model allows us to compare the relative contribution of different types of habitats to a species' growth rate and population size. Furthermore, we can also predict how the loss of habitat of a particular type may affect a population. This should make the model useful for environmental management problems as well as for describing the present distribution of a species across a spatially heterogeneous landscape.},

abstract = {Background: Drawing upon multiple types of knowledge (e.g., Indigenous knowledge, local knowledge, science-based knowledge) strengthens the evidence-base for policy advice, decision making, and environmental management. While the benefits of incorporating multiple types of knowledge in environmental research and management are many, doing so has remained a challenge. This systematic map examined the extent, range, and nature of the published literature (i.e., commercially published and grey) that seeks to respectively bridge Indigenous and science-based knowledge in coastal and marine research and management in Canada. Methods: This systematic map applied standardized search terms across four databases focused on commercially published literature, carefully selected specialist websites, and two web-based search engines. In addition, reference sections of relevant review articles were cross-checked to identify articles that may not have been found using the search strategy. Search results were screened in two sequential stages; (1) at title and abstract; and (2) at full text following a published protocol. All case studies included were coded using a standard questionnaire. A narrative synthesis approach was used to identify trends in the evidence, knowledge gaps, and knowledge clusters. Results: A total of 62 articles that spanned 71 Canadian case studies were included in the systematic map. Studies across the coastal and marine regions of Inuit Nunangat accounted for the majority of the studies. Whether the focus is on management and decision making or research and monitoring, the predominant ecological scale was at the species level, accounting for over two-thirds of the included studies. There were 24 distinct coastal and marine species of central focus across the studies. Nunavut had the greatest taxonomic coverage as studies conducted to date cover 13 different genera. The predominant methodology employed for combining and/or including Indigenous knowledge was case study design, which accounted for over half of the studies. Other methodologies employed for combining and/or including different ways of knowing included: (i) community-based participatory research; (ii) mixed methods; (iii) ethnography; and (iv) simulation modelling. There are a suite of methods utilized for documenting and translating Indigenous knowledge and an equally diverse tool box of methods used in the collection of scientific data. Over half of the case studies involved Indigenous knowledge systems of the Inuit, while another significant proportion involved Indigenous knowledge systems of First Nations, reflecting 21 unique nations. We found that demographics of knowledge holders were generally not reported in the articles reviewed. Conclusions: The results of this systematic map provide key insights to inform and improve future research. First, a variety of methodologies and methods are used in these types of studies. Therefore, there is a need to consider in more detail how Indigenous and science-based knowledge systems can be respectively bridged across subjects while also recognizing specific place-based needs of Indigenous communities. Second, the work highlights the need to better report the demographics of knowledge holders. Further inquiry focused on the extent of knowledge co-production and assessing Indigenous participation across different stages of the research process would serve the research community well to improve future research and monitoring in support of, and to strengthen, evidence-based environmental management.},

abstract = {Introduction: Fisheries management is often data-limited, and conducted at spatial scales that are too large to address the needs of Indigenous peoples, whose cultures depend upon the local availability of marine resources. Outcomes: We combined Indigenous ecological knowledge with simulation modelling to inform modern fishery management. Semi-structured interviews with Indigenous fishers in coastal British Columbia, Canada, uncovered severe declines in the abundance and catches of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) since the 1990s. We modelled the current probability of “successful“ crab harvesting trips—as defined by expectations from past catches by Indigenous fishers—using fishery-independent data from nine sites. These probabilities were very low (<20%) for all sites except one. Discussion: Our study highlights that local depletions, which Indigenous fishers attribute to commercial and recreational fisheries, have been widespread and undetected by federal managers who manage Dungeness crab at regional scales without fishery-independent data. Further, local depletions impacted the ability of Indigenous fishers to access traditional foods. Conclusion: Integrating Indigenous knowledge with scientific research is crucial to inform locally-relevant fisheries management and conservation.},

Here, we analyzed steelhead trout (anadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss) adult abundance time series from 35 coastal British Columbia and Washington populations along with smolt-to-adult return (smolt survival) time series from 48 populations from Washington, Oregon, and the Keogh River in British Columbia. Over 80% of the populations have declined in abundance since 1980. A multivariate autoregressive statespace model revealed smolt survival four groupings: Washington and Oregon coast, lower Columbia River, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound – Keogh River populations. Declines in smolt survival rates were seen for three of the four groupings. Puget Sound and Keogh River populations have experienced low rates since the early 1990s. Correlations between population pairs' time series and distance apart illustrated that smolt survival rates were more positively correlated for proximate populations, suggesting that important processes, including those related to ocean survival, occur early in the marine life of steelhead.},

abstract = {Increasingly, fisheries researchers and managers seek or are compelled to “bridge” Indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific approaches to understanding and governing fisheries. Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi'kmaw) embraces “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,” as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative—central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

abstract = {Controlling exotic aquatic weeds such as Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) is a high priority for many aquatic plant management programs.  Yet, the effects of Eurasian watermilfoil invasion and subsequent removal on sportfish production and food webs are insufficiently understood.  Changes in aquatic plant abundance or architecture, caused by invasion and/or removal of exotic plants, may affect age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lacepede) growth and recruitment.  We hypothesized that age-0 largemouth bass piscivory and growth: 1) decreases along a gradient of increasing Eurasian watermilfoil coverage and 2) benefits from low-dose applications of fluridone herbicide intended to shift Eurasian watermilfoil dominated plant communities to native dominated plant communities.  In a multiple lake evaluation of the effects of selective removal of Eurasian watermilfoil on age-0 largemouth bass, percent coverage of Eurasian watermilfoil ranged 8% to 50% in lakes treated with 5 to 7 ppb fluridone and 43% to 91% in reference lakes.  Coverage of native plants ranged from 62% to 95%.  Selective removal of Eurasian watermilfoil did not have a significant positive effect on age-0 largemouth bass growth.  Rather, age-0 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque) prey availability, which varied considerably among lakes, had a strong positive effect on age-0 largemouth bass piscivory and growth.  Factors influencing age-0 bluegill availability to age-0 largemouth bass appear more related to size structure of largemouth bass and bluegill populations than to plant cover.},

abstract = {Rapid climate changes are currently driving substantial reorganizations of marine ecosystems around the world. A key question is how these changes will alter the provision of ecosystem services from the ocean, particularly from fisheries. To answer this question, we need to understand not only the ecological dynamics of marine systems, but also human adaptation and feedbacks between humans and the rest of the natural world. In this review, we outline what we have learned from research primarily in continental shelf ecosystems and fishing communities of North America. Key findings are that marine animals are highly sensitive to warming and are responding quickly to changes in water temperature, and that such changes are often happening faster than similar processes on land. Changes in species distributions and productivity are having substantial impacts on fisheries, including through changing catch compositions and longer distances traveled for fishing trips. Conflicts over access to fisheries have also emerged as species distributions are no longer aligned with regulations or catch allocations. These changes in the coupled natural-human system have reduced the value of ecosystem services from some fisheries and risk doing so even more in the future. Going forward, substantial opportunities for more effective fisheries management and operations, marine conservation, and marine spatial planning are likely possible through greater consideration of climate information over time-scales from years to decades.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are expected to benefit a wide range of species, but most models used to evaluate their effects assume that adults are sedentary, thereby potentially overestimating population persistence. Many nearshore marine organisms move within a home range as adults, and there is a need to understand the effects of this type of movement on reserve performance. We incorporated movement within a home range into a spatially explicit marine reserve model in order to assess the combined effects of adult and larval movement on persistence and yield in a general, strategic framework. We describe how the capacity of a population to persist decreased with increasing home range size in a manner that depended on whether the sedentary case was maintained by self persistence or network persistence. Self persistence declined gradually with increasing home range and larval dispersal distance, while network persistence decreased sharply to 0 above a threshold home range and was less dependent on larval dispersal distance. The maximum home range size protected by a reserve network increased with the fraction of coastline in reserves and decreasing exploitation rates outside reserves. Spillover due to movement within a home range contributed to yield moderately under certain conditions, although yield contributions were generally not as large as those from spillover due to larval dispersal. Our results indicate that, for species exhibiting home range behavior, persistence in a network of marine reserves may be more predictable than previously anticipated from models based solely on larval dispersal, in part due to better knowledge of home range sizes. Including movement within a home range can change persistence results significantly from those assuming that adults are sedentary; hence it is an important consideration in reserve design.},

Descrip- tions of diet and spatial resource use, measures of prey availability, and risk to intra-specific interactions allowed assessment of the relative contributions ofexploitative and interference competitive interactions among size classes. Growth of the larger classes was strongly density-dependent and driven primarily by exploitative competition. Growth of the smallest size class was controlled by a combination of exploitative competition within and among size classes and interference competition with larger-bodied conspecifics. This combination of interactions among size classes within populations resulted in a body-size-based asymmetry favoring the larger size classes. Sur- vival ofall size classes was positively related to both body size and growth rate.

Pacific Herring are emblematic of the management issues facing forage species—they are central components of the Northeast Pacific pelagic food web and support important commercial fisheries. In addition, the importance of Herring to indigenous peoples have made them cultural keystone species. We employed a participatory process to promote collaborative priority-setting for this critical forage species. Working with managers, the fisheries industry, indigenous peoples, and scientists, we co-constructed a conceptual model of the Pacific Herring social–ecological system () in the Northeast Pacific. We then identified a set of questions, that, if answered, would significantly increase our ability to sustainably manage the Herring. Our objective was to generate a road map for scientists who wish to conduct useful forage fish research, for resource managers who wish to develop new research efforts that could fill critical gaps, and for public agencies and private foundations seeking to prioritize funding on forage fish issues in the Pacific. With this socio-cultural centrality comes complexity for fisheries management. Our participatory process highlighted the value of conceptualizing the full SES, overcame disciplinary differences in scientific approaches, research philosophy, and language, and charted a path forward for future research and management for forage species.},

The present Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries are focused on recreational fisheries and describe strategies to promote environmentally sustainable and socially responsible management of such fisheries. To this end, the document details policy, management and behavioural recommendations for sustainable recreational fisheries that are an increasingly important component of global fisheries. Specifically, the Guidelines translate the relevant provisions of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries into specific advice for recreational fisheries. The concept of aquatic stewardship is introduced as an overarching ethical framework needed to achieve ecologically sustainable recreational fisheries on a global scale. Within this normative mindset, the adaptive management philosophy based on quantifiable and transparent objectives and continuous learning and feedback loops is proposed along with the acknowledgement of principles such as the ecosystem approach and the precautionary approach.},

abstract = {Flow and temperature are strongly linked environmental factors driving ecosystem processes in streams. Stream temperature maxima (Tmax_w) and stream flow minima (Qmin) can create periods of stress for aquatic organisms. In mountainous areas, such as western North America, recent shifts toward an earlier spring peak flow and decreases in low flow during summer/fall have been reported. We hypothesized that an earlier peak flow could be shifting the timing of low flow and leading to a decrease in the interval between Tmax_w and Qmin. We also examined if years with extreme low Qmin were associated with years of extreme high Tmax_w. We tested these hypotheses using long-term data from 22 minimally human-influenced streams for the period 1950-2010. We found trends toward a shorter time lag between Tmax_w and Qmin over time and a strong negative association between their magnitudes. Our findings show that aquatic biota may be increasingly experiencing narrower time windows to recover or adapt between these extreme events of low flow and high temperature. This study highlights the importance of evaluating multiple environmental drivers to better gage the effects of the recent climate variability in freshwaters. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Mixed-stock fisheries simultaneously exploit populations that may differ in their conservation status, and uncertainty in stock-specific harvest rates can hamper evaluations of recovery prospects for depressed populations. These difficulties are exemplified in the Sockeye Salmon population from the Atnarko watershed, which collapsed in the early 2000s, causing cultural and economic hardship. A recovery plan identified the incidental harvest of Sockeye Salmon by mixed-stock fisheries in the Atnarko as a potential, but poorly understood, impediment to recovery. We reconstructed harvest rates for salmon in Indigenous and commercial fisheries and used an age-structured state-space model of stock–recruit dynamics to predict how a range of future mixed-stock harvest rates would influence recovery. Under recent harvest rates, there is a 50–60% chance that the population will grow to exceed a recovery goal of 15,000 spawners over the next four generations. Eliminating the harvest of Sockeye Salmon altogether increased predicted recovery prospects to a maximum of 69%, suggesting that factors other than fisheries are contributing to the lack of recovery (e.g., ocean conditions) and that harvest management alone is unlikely to lead to recovery with a high degree of certainty. We developed a generalized migration, harvest, and catch monitoring simulation model to quantify how different monitoring scenarios might improve estimates for mixed-stock harvest rates. Increasing the number of specimens collected for genetic samples improved the harvest rate estimates for each stock caught in the mixed-stock fisheries, particularly for the smallest stocks, and relative to single sampling events conducted near the peak of the return migration, weekly sampling improved estimates only slightly but provided insurance against missing the peak of the return migration. Our study highlights collaborative research initiated and directed by the Nuxalk Nation to promote the recovery of a depressed stock that is inherent to traditional foods, thereby contributing to a global effort to integrate Indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

abstract = {Gravity models are commonly used by geographers to predict migration and interaction between populations and regions. Even though rarely used by ecologists, gravity models allow estimation of long-distance dispersal between discrete points in heterogeneous landscapes. We developed a production-constrained gravity model to forecast zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) dispersal into inland lakes of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin (USA) based on the site and location of lakes and the number and location of boats within 364 counties. A deterministic form of this model was used to estimate best- fit parameters for distance coefficient, Great Lakes boat-ramp attractiveness, and coloni- zation cutoff threshold. A stochastic model thus developed from these parameters allows for random changes in colonization likelihood. The results of our model are highly correlated with the actual pattern of colonized lakes in southern Michigan and southeasternWisconsin at the end of 1997. Areas of central Wisconsin and western Michigan, where zebra mussel colonies have not been documented, were also predicted to be colonized, suggesting that future invasions may be imminent in these locations. These analyses suggest that gravity models may be useful in predicting long-distance dispersal when dispersal abilities of species and the attractiveness of potential habitats are known},

abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting marine protected areas (MPAs) and MPA networks, yet adaptation strategies are rarely incorporated into MPA design and management plans according to the primary scientific literature. Here we review the state of knowledge for adapting existing and future MPAs to climate change and synthesize case studies (n = 27) of how marine conservation planning can respond to shifting environmental conditions. First, we derive a generalized conservation planning framework based on five published frameworks that incorporate climate change adaptation to inform MPA design. We then summarize examples from the scientific literature to assess how conservation goals were defined, vulnerability assessments performed and adaptation strategies incorporated into the design and management of existing or new MPAs. Our analysis revealed that 82% of real-world examples of climate change adaptation in MPA planning derive from tropical reefs, highlighting the need for research in other ecosystems and habitat types. We found contrasting recommendations for adaptation strategies at the planning stage, either focusing only on climate refugia, or aiming for representative protection of areas encompassing the full range of expected climate change impacts. Recommendations for MPA management were more unified and focused on adaptative management approaches. Lastly, we evaluate common barriers to adopting climate change adaptation strategies based on reviewing studies which conducted interviews with MPA managers and other conservation practitioners. This highlights a lack of scientific studies evaluating different adaptation strategies and shortcomings in current governance structures as two major barriers, and we discuss how these could be overcome. Our review provides a comprehensive synthesis of planning frameworks, case studies, adaptation strategies and management actions which can inform a more coordinated global effort to adapt existing and future MPA networks to continued climate change.},

abstract = {Measuring fishing effort is one important element for effective management of recreational fisheries. Traditional intensive angler intercept survey methods collect many observations on a few water bodies per year to produce highly accurate estimates of fishing effort. However, scaling up this approach to understand landscapes with many systems, such as lake districts, is problematic. In these situations, spatially extensive sampling might be preferable to the traditional intensive sampling method. Here we validate a model-based approach that uses a smaller number of observations collected using multiple methods from many fishing sites to estimate total fishing effort across a fisheries landscape. We distributed on-site and aerial observations of fishing effort across 44 lakes in Vilas County, Wisconsin and then used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to account for seasonal and daily trends as well as lake-specific differences in mean fishing effort. Estimates of total summer fishing effort predicted by GLMMs were on average within 11 % of those produced by traditional mean expansion. These estimates required less sampling effort per lake and can be produced for many more lakes per year. In spite of the higher uncertainty associated with model-based estimates from fewer observations, the improvements associated with the addition of only three aerial observations per lake highlighted the potential for improved precision with relatively few additional observations. Thus, the combination of GLMMs and extensive data collection from multiple sources could be used to estimate fishing effort in regions where intensive data collection for all fishing sites is infeasible, such as lake-rich landscapes. By using these methods of extensive data collection and model-based analysis, managers can produce frequently updated assessments of system states, which are important in developing proactive and dynamic management policies.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists often ignore density dependence because at-risk populations are typically small relative to historical levels. However, if populations are reduced as a result of impacts that lower carrying capacity, then density-dependent mortality may exist at low population abundances. Here, we explore this issue in threatened populations of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We followed the fate of more than 50 000 juvenile chinook in the Snake River Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that their survival was inversely associated with juvenile density. We also tested the hypotheses that non-indigenous brook trout and habitat quality affect the presence or strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that juvenile chinook suffer density-dependent mortality and the strength of density dependence was greater in streams in which brook trout were absent. We were unable to detect an effect of habitat quality on the strength of density dependence. Historical impacts of humans have greatly reduced population sizes of salmon, and the density dependence we report may stem from a shortage of nutrients normally derived from decomposing salmon carcasses. Cohorts of juvenile salmon may experience density-dependent mortality at population sizes far below historical levels and recovery of imperiled populations may be much slower than currently expected.},

The ratio of the fished to unfished magnitude of P is the spawning potential ratio (SPA) and is a measure of the impact of fishing on the potential productivity of a stock. Currenluse of SPR merges concepts developed to quantify the compensation required for population persistence given anthropogenic increases in mortality with observations of stock productivity and SSBR for fisheries in the Western North Atlantic. It has a firm theoretical basis and is evaluated against yield per recruit and contrasted with pther traditional biological reference points. SPR is widely used in U.S. fisheries managed under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, usually in the context of a percentage of the unflShed SSBR. lis implementation is intended to be risk-aversive through selection of minimum acceptable levels above which stocks maintain acceptable productivity. The behavior of the underlying principles suggests SPR values below about 0.2 should be avoided unless thare is evidence for exceptionally strong density-dependence in the stock. Critical levels have typically been set in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 primarily based upon the experience in the northwest Atlantic.},

abstract = {In streams where water availability is limited, conservative flow ranges are often adopted by water managers to ensure that streamflow is available to meet the ecological requirements of aquatic organisms. However, a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances can influence stream channel morphology and in-stream wood characteristics through time, potentially altering the availability of habitat at a given flow level. Using a 2D hydrodynamic modelling approach incorporating 45 years of detailed channel morphology data from Carnation Creek, British Columbia, this paper examines relationships between legacy (forestry-driven) watershed disturbance, changes to channel morphology, and habitat availability for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) under nine flow levels. Results indicate that substantial variability in the abundance of salmonid habitat is present through time, even when modelled flow levels are held constant. Additionally, trade-offs were observed between availability of habitat types as discharge increased. Finally, modelling results indicate that habitat availability is reduced following historical harvesting. These findings suggest that legacy watershed disturbances affecting stream channel form and function are worth considering when allocating streamflow.},

abstract = {The possibility for fishery-induced evolution of life history traits is an important but unresolved issue for exploited fish populations. Because fisheries tend to select and remove the largest individuals, there is the evolutionary potential for lasting effects on fish production and productivity. Size selection represents an indirect mechanism of selection against rapid growth rate, because individual fish may be large because of rapid growth or because of slow growth but old age. The possibility for direct selection on growth rate, whereby fast-growing genotypes are more vulnerable to fishing irrespective of their size, is unexplored. In this scenario, faster-growing genotypes may be more vulnerable to fishing because of greater appetite and correspondingly greater feeding-related activity rates and boldness that could increase encounter with fishing gear and vulnerability to it. In a realistic whole-lake experiment, we show that fast-growing fish genotypes are harvested at three times the rate of the slow-growing genotypes within two replicate lake populations. Overall, 50% of fast-growing individuals were harvested compared with 30% of slow-growing individuals, independent of body size. Greater harvest of fast-growing genotypes was attributable to their greater behavioral vulnerability, being more active and bold. Given that growth is heritable in fishes, we speculate that evolution of slower growth rates attributable to behavioral vulnerability may be widespread in harvested fish populations. Our results indicate that commonly used minimum size-limits will not prevent overexploitation of fast-growing genotypes and individuals because of size-independent growth-rate selection by fishing.},

abstract = {Populations of sardine, anchovy, and other forage species can fluctuate to low levels due to climate variability and fishing, leading to indirect effects on marine food webs. In the context of recent declines of sardine (Sardinops sagax) and anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in the California Current, we apply an end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model that is spatially explicit, includes trophic interactions, and allows high and low recruitment regimes (production of juveniles). Our simulations suggest that depleted sardine populations, whether caused by fishing or natural cycles, may lead to declines in predator groups such as dolphins and large piscivorous flatfish (e.g. California halibut Paralichthys californicus). Birds exhibited more moderate declines, and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) exhibited relatively weak declines. The Atlantis ecosystem model also predicted indirect positive effects of sardine depletion, primarily for prey species such as zooplankton. Overall our model predicted moderate declines in most predators during simulated severe declines in sardine and anchovy, illustrating the important buffering role provided by forage species other than sardine and anchovy. This ‘buffered response' is weaker than what would be suggested by another ecosystem model (Ecosim), as predicted by diet information and a global synthesis of Ecosim models (the PREP equation). One limitation of the Atlantis model is that it did not include processes that might give rise to localized depletion of sardine at scales relevant to central place foragers, such as birds and pinnipeds. This analysis will contribute to a collaborative multi-model approach that evaluates the role of sardine in the California Current.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. The Safe Operating Space (SOS) of a recreational fishery is the multidimensional region defined by levels of harvest, angler effort, habitat, predation and other factors in which the fishery is sustainable into the future. SOS boundaries exhibit trade-offs such that decreases in harvest can compensate to some degree for losses of habitat, increases in predation and increasing value of fishing time to anglers. Conversely, high levels of harvest can be sustained if habitat is intact, predation is low, and value of fishing effort is moderate. The SOS approach recognizes limits in several dimensions: at overly high levels of harvest, habitat loss, predation, or value of fishing effort, the stock falls to a low equilibrium biomass. Recreational fisheries managers can influence harvest and perhaps predation, but they must cope with trends that are beyond their control such as changes in climate, loss of aquatic habitat or social factors that affect the value of fishing effort for anglers. The SOS illustrates opportunities to manage harvest or predation to maintain quality fisheries in the presence of trends in climate, social preferences or other factors that are not manageable.},

abstract = {Mathematical modelling is playing an increasing role in studies of ecological systems. This requires the communication of the details of a mathematical model, including the use of mathematical notation to represent ecological variables, parameters and processes. In our experience, the clarity of mathematical notation varies between papers and can often be inconsistent with general conventions. Poor notation can impede communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more complicated than necessary. Here, we present some guidelines, including: (a) define every term in an equation, (b) use fonts appropriately (italicise mathematical symbols, use bold lower case for vectors and bold upper case for matrices), (c) use subscripts appropriately (to index quantities, for example, by year), (d) use superscripts appropriately (to indicate a power, the transpose of a matrix or the steady-state value of a quantity), (e) avoid multiletter variable names, and (f) revisit notation early on in a project to see if it should be refined. Although we focus mainly on ecology, our guidelines should be of interest to researchers applying models in evolutionary biology and broader areas of biology.},

abstract = {There is a need to explicitly consider metapopulation dynamics in the development of conservation strategies for spatially-structured populations. We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically-based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identified a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied >90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently other streams make only small contributions to population abundance, however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.},

Current monitoring and management efforts rely on a mix of community-led initiatives, Fisheries and Oceans Canada-led monitoring programs, and research projects of varying duration and scope. While these efforts collectively provide important information for salmon management, there is an urgent need to work towards greater coordination and investment in salmon monitoring and stewardship to ensure that the information that underpins decision-making is being collected.This project represents a collaborative effort between the Pacific Salmon Foundation, the Kitasoo/Xai'xais, Nuxalk, Heiltsuk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations, the Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada to develop a regional Salmon Monitoring and Stewardship Framework for British Columbia's Central Coast. Using a structured decision-making process, a Technical Working Group (many of whom are co-authors on this report) identified goals, objectives, strategies, and on-the-ground actions for salmon monitoring and stewardship in the region. The resulting Monitoring Framework reflects a suite of priority monitoring, coordination, and community engagement actions needed to monitor and assess salmon in order to meet shared salmon conservation and management goals. Ultimately, our intent is that this framework can support and inform emerging collaborative monitoring and management efforts for salmon in the region including through emerging opportunities under the Fisheries Resources Reconciliation Agreement.},

Selection for N. verticillata by mosquitofish was significant for both the equal and natural treatments, and thus was not caused by differences in plant density alone. Sailfin mollies displayed significant selection for H. verticillata only in the natural plant-density treatments. Dollar sunfish showed less consistent habitat selection than either mosquitofish or sailfin mollies. Significant habitat selection was not found in the absence of a predator, and there was no evidence for selection among the tank areas in control treatments.

abstract = {Reserves are being used increasingly to conserve fish communities and populations under threat from overfishing, but little consideration has been given to how fish behavior might affect reserve function. This review examines the implications of how fish use space, in particular the occurrence and size of home ranges and the frequency and direction of home range relocations. Examples are drawn primarily from the literature on coral reef fishes, but the principles apply to other habitats. Reserves can protect fish species only if individuals restrict their movements to a localized home range during at least part of the life cycle. Home range sizes increase with body size. In small reserves, a significant proportion of fish whose home ranges are centered within the reserve can be exposed to fishing mortality because their home ranges include non-reserve areas. Relocation of home ranges following initial settlement increases exposure to the fishery, especially if habitat selection is frequency-dependent. Distance, barriers, and costs of movement counter such redistribution. These considerations lead to predictions that population density and mean fish size (1) will form gradients across reserve boundaries with maxima in the center of the reserve and minima outside the reserve away from the boundary; (2) will increase rapidly in newly established reserves, only later providing ‘spillover' to adjacent fisheries as density-dependent emigration begins to take effect; and (3) will be higher in reserves that are larger and have higher area:edge ratios, more habitat types, natural barriers between reserve and non-reserve areas, and higher habitat quality inside than outside the reserve. (4) Species with low mobility and weak density-dependence of space use will show the greatest increase in reserves and the strongest benefit for population reproductive capacity, but those with intermediate levels of these traits will provide the greatest spillover benefit to nearby fisheries.},

Evaluation of climate risk across different vessel groups within a particular fishery requires consideration of heterogeneous climate impacts on the availability of multiple target species and how such changes may impact substitution behavior. Here we analyze how historical climate-driven changes in forage species distribution and the closure of the Pacific sardine fishery affected landings per vessel of three coastal pelagic species (CPS): Pacific sardine ( Sardinops sagax), market squid ( Doryteuthis opalescens), and northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax) targeted by the U.S. West Coast CPS fleet from 2000 to 2020. Using cluster analysis, we grouped vessels into different fleet segments and estimated heterogeneous responses by fleet segment and port area. Our results show that considering heterogeneity is essential in the development of equitable and effective adaptation policies designed to mitigate the impact of changes on species availability in these fisheries.},

Herein, we describe variation in lake charr S. namaycush morphology, life history, physiology and ecology, as another example of radiation. The lake charr is restricted to northern North America, where it originated from glacial refugia and diversified in large lakes. Shallow and deepwater morphs arose in multiple lakes, with a large-bodied shallow-water ‘lean' morph in shallow inshore depths, a small-bodied mid-water ‘humper' morph on offshore shoals or banks, a robust, large-bodied moderate to deep-water ‘redfin'; morph and a large-bodied deep-water ‘siscowet' morph at depths > 100 m. Eye position, gape size, and gillraker length and spacing adapted for feeding on different-sized prey, with piscivorous morphs (leans, siscowets and presumably redfins) reaching larger asymptotic size than invertivorous morphs (humpers). Lean morphs are light in colour, whereas deepwater morphs are drab and dark, although the pattern is reversed in dark tannic lakes. Morphs shift from benthic to pelagic feeding at a length of 400–490 mm. Phenotypic differences in locomotion, buoyancy and lipid metabolism evolved into different mechanisms for buoyancy regulation, with lean morphs relying on hydrodynamic lift and siscowet morphs relying on hydrostatic lift. We suggest that the Salvelinus genus, rather than the species S. alpinus, is a diverse genus that should be the subject of comparative studies of processes causing divergence and adaptation among member species that may lead to a more complete evolutionary conceptual model.},

Results indicate that the constant-parameter transition probabilities for all species in the mixed uneven-aged forest could be classified into 3 groups based on the mean upgrowth probabilities of each species: (1) Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandshurica), walnut (Juglans regia), Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica) and poplar (Populus) have largest upgrowth probabilities (0.36775); (2) birch (Betula), amur linder (Tilia amurensis) and other species (0.26681); and (3) ash-leaved maple [Acer negundo], elm (Ulmus) and amur cocktree (Phellodendron amurense) having the smallest upgrowth probability (0.17185). Constant-parameter transition probabilities of all species in each diameter class fluctuate within a narrow range except for diameter classes below 8 cm and greater than 60 cm. Variable-parameter transition probabilities were found to be a function of residual basal area for small diameter classes. For large trees, transition probabilities are not affected by the residual basal area. Based on this study, variable-parameter transition probabilities for large diameter trees can be replaced with constant-parameter transition probabilities.

abstract = {The steepness parameter of the stock-recruitment relationship (the proportion of unfished recruitment when spawning biomass is reduced to 20% of its unfished level) is a key parameter in stock assessment models, and hence in the provision of scientific management advice for many fisheries. Prior probability distributions for steepness have been used when conducting assessments of US west coast groundfish in the absence of data to estimate steepness reliably. These priors have been developed by applying meta-analytic methods to the results from stock assessments, but the performances of these methods have not been evaluated. Three potential methods for applying meta-analysis to construct steepness priors are available: non-linear mixed models, Bayesian hierarchical methods, and a novel method which approximates marginal likelihoods using likelihood profiles. These methods are evaluated using simulation. The profile method is found to perform best. Estimates of the parameters which define the steepness prior are uncertain owing primarily to uncertainty associated with the results of the stock assessments which provide the input for the meta-analysis methods, and because of the small number of stocks available for inclusion in the meta-analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The wider effects of fishing on marine ecosystems have become the focus of growing concern among scientists, fisheries managers and the fishing industry. The present review examines the role of habitat structure and habitat heterogeneity in marine ecosystems, and the effects of fishing (i.e. trawling and dredging) on these two components of habitat complexity. Three examples from New Zealand and Australia are considered, where available evidence suggests that fishing has been associated with the degradation or loss of habitat structure through the removal of large epibenthic organisms, with concomitant effects on fish species which occupy these habitats. With ever-increasing demands on fish-stocks and the need for sustainable use of fisheries resources, new approaches to fisheries management are needed. Fisheries management needs to address the sustainability of fish-stocks while minimizing the direct and indirect impacts of fishing on other components of the ecosystem. Two long-term management tools for mitigating degradation or loss of habitat structure while maintaining healthy sustainable fisheries which are increasingly considered by fisheries scientists and managers are: (1) protective habitat management, which involves the designation of protected marine and coastal areas which are afforded some level of protection from fishing; and (2) habitat restoration, whereby important habitat and ecological functions are restored following the loss of habitat and/or resources. Nevertheless, the protection of marine and coastal areas, and habitat restoration should not be seen as solutions replacing conventional management approaches, but need to be components of an integrated programme of coastal zone and fisheries management. A number of recent international fisheries agreements have specifically identified the need to provide for habitat protection and restoration to ensure long-term sustainability of fisheries. The protection and restoration of habitat are also common components of fisheries management programs under national fisheries law and policy.},

abstract = {Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of pre-diction errors. These may be of two types: false posi-tives and false negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological processes such as unsatu-rated habitat and species interactions. Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological con-text the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are seldom used by ecol-ogists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are de-scribed. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen recommendations are made to enable the objective selection of an error assessment technique for ecological presence/absence models.},

Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population},

The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this "fishery relevant" scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.},

In an agent-based model, we simulate agents harvesting a renewable resource, and examine the effect of agents in different social networks on their ability to exploit the resource under different levels of uncertainty. When uncertainty in the resource is high, under assumed conditions, ordered social networks can exploit the resources better by passing information among the agents than when individuals act independently of each other. The more highly connected random networks, however, leads to lower aggregate harvests. When a single "skilled" agent is able to obtain a greater harvest than the others, a hierarchical performance among agents results, with those connected directly to the "skilled" agent obtaining higher harvests than those that are not. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predator effects on prey dynamics are conventionally studied by measuring changes in prey abundance attributed to consumption by predators. We revisit four classic examples of predator-prey systems often cited in textbooks and incorporate subsequent studies of nonconsumptive effects of predators (NCE), defined as changes in prey traits (e.g., behavior, growth, development) measured on an ecological time scale. Our review revealed that NCE were integral to explaining lynx-hare population dynamics in boreal forests, cascading effects of top predators in Wisconsin lakes, and cascading effects of killer whales and sea otters on kelp forests in nearshore marine habitats. The relative roles of consumption and NCE of wolves on moose and consequent indirect effects on plant communities of Isle Royale depended on climate oscillations. Nonconsumptive effects have not been explicitly tested to explain the link between planktonic alewives and the size structure of the zooplankton, nor have they been invoked to attribute keystone predator status in intertidal communities or elsewhere. We argue that both consumption and intimidation contribute to the total effects of keystone predators, and that characteristics of keystone consumers may differ from those of predators having predominantly NCE. Nonconsumptive effects are often considered as an afterthought to explain observations inconsistent with consumption-based theory. Consequently, NCE with the same sign as consumptive effects may be overlooked, even though they can affect the magnitude, rate, or scale of a prey response to predation and can have important management or conservation implications. Nonconsumptive effects may underlie other classic paradigms in ecology, such as delayed density dependence and predator-mediated prey coexistence. Revisiting classic studies enriches our understanding of predator-prey dynamics and provides compelling rationale for ramping up efforts to consider how NCE affect traditional predator-prey models based on consumption, and to compare the relative magnitude of consumptive and NCE of predators.},

After model fitting, the spawning stock size that produces the maximum sustainable yield (SMSY) to a fishery, and the harvest corresponding to it (UMSY), are two of the most common biological reference points of interest to fisheries managers. However, to date there has been no explicit solution for either reference point because of the transcendental nature of the equation needed to solve for them. Therefore, numerical or statistical approximations have been used for more than 30 years.

abstract = {Observational data from the past century have highlighted the importance of interdecadal modes of variability in fish population dynamics, but how these patterns of variation fit into a broader temporal and spatial context remains largely unknown. We analyzed time series of stable nitrogen isotopes from the sediments of 20 sockeye salmon nursery lakes across western Alaska to characterize temporal and spatial patterns in salmon abundance over the past ?500 y. Although some stocks varied on interdecadal time scales (30- to 80-y cycles), centennial-scale variation, undetectable inmodern-daycatchrecords and survey data, has dominated salmon population dynamics over the past 500 y. Before 1900, variation in abundance was clearly not synchronous among stocks, and the only temporal signal common to lake sediment records from this region was the on set of commercial fishing in the late 1800s. Thus, historical changes in climate did not synchronize stock dynamics over centennial time scales, emphasizing that ecosystem complexity can produce a diversity of ecological responses to regional climate forcing. Our results show that marine fish populations may alternate between naturally driven periods of high and low abundance over time scales of decades to centuries and suggest that management models that assume time-invariant productivity or carrying capacity parameters may be poor representations of the biological reality in these systems.},

Yelloweye Rockfish are caught by all fishing gear types (jig, troll, set-line, and trawl) in Aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries. Since the inception of the ZN licensed directed hook and line rockfish fishery in 1986, fishery management has been applied over two management units: inside and outside. Yelloweye Rockfish have been assessed together with other inshore rockfish species since 1986. In 2006, a stock status report was prepared for the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). COSEWIC recognized two designatable units (DUs), or populations, of Yelloweye Rockfish in British Columbia; inside and outside. In 2008, COSEWIC designated both populations as special concern.

abstract = {Climate-induced phenological shifts can influence population, evolutionary, and ecological dynamics, but our understanding of these phenomena is hampered by a lack of long-term demographic data. We use a multi-decade census of 5 salmonid species representing 14 life histories in a warming Alaskan stream to address the following key questions about climate change and phenology: How consistent are temporal patterns and drivers of phenology for similar species and alternative life histories? Are shifts in phenology associated with changes in phenotypic variation? How do phenological changes influence the availability of resource subsidies? For most salmonid species, life stages, and life histories, freshwater temperature influences migration timing - migration events are occurring earlier in time (mean = 1.7 days earlier per decade over the 3-5 decades), and the number of days over which migration events occur is decreasing (mean = 1.5 days per decade). Temporal trends in migration timing were not correlated with changes in intra-annual phenotypic variation, suggesting that these components of the phenotypic distribution have responded to environmental change independently. Despite commonalities across species and life histories, there was important biocomplexity in the form of disparate shifts in migration timing and variation in the environmental factors influencing migration timing for alternative life history strategies in the same population. Overall, adult populations have been stable during these phenotypic and environmental changes ($\lambda$ ≈1.0), but the temporal availability of salmon as a resource in freshwater has decreased by nearly 30 days since 1971 due to changes in the median date of migration timing and decreases in intra-annual variation in migration timing. These novel observations advance our understanding of phenological change in response to climate warming, and indicate that climate change has influenced the ecology of salmon populations, which will have important consequences for the numerous species that depend on this resource. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kovach et al.},

abstract = {The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act recognizes that fish stocks depend on healthy ecosystems and requires that fishery managers expand their management regimes to include the very basis of healthy fisheries—the habitat itself. The 1996 amendments to this primary United States marine fishery-management law include a new mandate to identify habitats essential to managed living marine re- sources and to take steps to ensure that those habitats remain healthy and can support sustainable fisheries. Until now, the legislative mandate for protecting habitat for marine and anadromous stocks came through statutes not specifically focused on the needs of commercial and recreational fish species. Now, there is explicit linkage between fishery- management programs, traditionally designed to manage the harvesting activity itself, and efforts to ensure that fishing and nonfishing activities do not undermine the produc- tivity of the stocks. This emphasis on habitat health and productivity brings a broader ecosystem perspective to traditional fishery management.The insertion of essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions into fisheries management has been an enormous undertaking. The agency and the regional fishery management councils, working with other partners, completed the first stage of the process within very tight statutory deadlines. The coun- cils have made use of all of the tools provided them under the act and the EFH regula- tions, such as designating habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs), recommend-ing fishing restrictions within special areas, defining priority research and information needs, and documenting threats and conservation measures appropriate for federal ac- tions that may adversely affect EFH. This effort has entailed a great deal of scientific as well as policy analysis. We are currently implementing the federal consultation process to address threats to fish habitat in a consistent and timely manner.This new habitat thrust will align fishery managers and scientists with new allies in the habitat arena, increasing benefits to marine resource-management programs and fishery management. As sug- gested by the theme of this issue, an understanding and consideration of marine reserves and other special-area management concepts can benefit federal fishery management. This article gives an overview of how the fishery-management councils are fulfilling the essential fish habitat mandate by using a broader ecosystem approach to conservation that considers the ecological role of managed species, analyzes species' habitat needs from state waters to the high seas, and examines shifts in population health and sustainability over the course of decades.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that visual survey data provide more accurate fish counts than conventional extractive gear. As a result, use of underwater vehicles to assess the abundance and distribution of fishes has increased rapidly over recent years. However, a review of observations reported for 48 demersal marine fish taxa showed that almost all respond in some way to underwater vehicles. Whether or not movements or changes in behavior affect survey bias is more difficult to assess. A simple conceptual model is presented to evaluate relationships between stimulus intensity, distances from the vehicle where reactions occur, and survey bias. Largest bias is caused by attraction or avoidance that occurs outside the field of cameras or observers. While light level and vehicle speed have been explored experimentally in a few cases, much remains to be learned about how bias varies among species, age groups, different vehicles, and operating conditions. Given poor understanding of survey bias, we recommend that surveys be conducted with minimum possible variation in operations and that vehicle time is devoted to experimental evaluation of methods. There is no good substitute for direct observations on fish behavior, distribution, and abundance; and survey design can be improved through experimentation. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V. Recreational fisheries (RF) are complex social-ecological systems that play an important role in aquatic environments while generating significant social and economic benefits around the world. The nature of RF is diverse and rapidly evolving, including the participants, their priorities and behaviors, and the related ecological impacts and social and economic benefits. RF can lead to negative ecological impacts, particularly through overexploitation of fish populations and spread of non-native species and genotypes through stocking. Hence, careful management and monitoring of RF is essential to sustain these ecologically and socioeconomically important resources. This special issue on recreational fisheries contains diverse research, syntheses, and perspectives that highlight the advances being made in RF research, monitoring, management, and practice, which we summarize here. Co-management actions are rising, often involving diverse interest groups including government and non-government organizations; applying collaborative management practices can help balance social and economic benefits with conservation targets. Technological and methodological advances are improving the ability to monitor biological, social, and economic dynamics of RF, which underpin the ability to maximize RF benefits through management actions. To ensure RF sustainability, much research focuses on the ecological aspects of RF, as well as the development of management and angling practices that reduce negative impacts on fish populations. For example, angler behavior can be influenced to conform to conservation-minded angling practices through regulations, but is often best accomplished through growing bottom-up social change movements. Anglers can also play an important role in fisheries monitoring and conservation, including providing data on fish abundance and assemblages (i.e., citizen science). The increasing impacts that growing human populations are having on the global environment are threatening many of the natural resources and ecosystem services they provide, including valuable RF. However, with careful development of research initiatives, monitoring and management, sustainable RF can generate positive outcomes for both society and natural ecosystems and help solve allocation conflicts with commercial fisheries and conservation.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to relate species occurrence and density to local environmental conditions, and often include a spatially correlated variable to account for spatial patterns in residuals. Ecologists have extended SDMs to include spatially varying coefficients (SVCs), where the response to a given covariate varies smoothly over space and time. However, SVCs see relatively little use perhaps because they remain less known relative to other SDM techniques. We therefore review ecological contexts where SVCs can improve the interpretability and descriptive power from SDMs, including local responses to regional indices that represent ecological teleconnections; density-dependent habitat selection; spatially varying detectability; and context-dependent covariate responses that represent interactions with unmeasured covariates. We then illustrate three additional examples in detail using the vector autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model. First, a spatially varying decadal trends model identifies decadal trends for arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias density in the Bering Sea from 1982 to 2019. Second, a trait-based joint SDM highlights the role of body size and temperature in spatial community assembly in the Gulf of Alaska. Third, an age-structured SDM for walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus in the Bering Sea contrasts cohorts with broad spatial distributions (1996 and 2009) and those that are more spatially constrained (2002 and 2015). We conclude that SVCs extend SDMs to address a wide variety of ecological contexts and can be used to better understand a range of ecological processes, e.g. density dependence, community assembly and population dynamics.},

abstract = {We use focal-species analysis to apply a graph-theoretic approach to landscape connectivity in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. In doing so we demonstrate the utility of a mathematical graph as an ecological construct with respect to habitat connectivity. Graph theory is a well established mainstay of information technology and is concerned with highly efficient network flow. It employs fast algorithms and compact data structures that are easily adapted to landscape-level focal species analysis. American mink (Mustela vison) and prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) share the same habitat but have different dispersal capabilities, and therefore provide interesting comparisons on connections in the landscape. We built graphs using GIS coverages to define habitat patches and determined the functional distance between the patches with least-cost path modeling. Using graph operations concerned with edge and node removal we found that the landscape is fundamentally connected for mink and fundamentally unconnected for prothonotary warblers. The advantage of a graph-theoretic approach over other modeling techniques is that it is a heuristic framework which can be applied with very little data and improved from the initial results. We demonstrate the use of graph theory in a metapopulation context, and suggest that graph theory as applied to conservation biology can provide leverage on applications concerned with landscape connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

Large errors make recruitments appear to be independent of spawning stocks. This effect promotes overexploitation rather than simply making the relationship noisier and harder to measure. Efforts to explain variation in recruitment through factors other than spawning stock may be deceptive as well. Much fisheries theory and practice are based on the assumption that recruitment is largely independent of spawning stock; that assumption is not credible except in cases where spawning stocks are known to have been measured accurately.Key words: stock, recruitment, statistics, overexploitation},

abstract = {1. Habitat degradation is seriously threatening stream biodiversity and productivity world-wide. For salmonid fish, restoration projects in disturbed systems commonly aim at increasing the availability of suitable breeding habitats, but expectations of effects on population abundance based on explicit models are lacking. 2. We used a spatial population model to predict how breeder dispersion may influence population dynamics of salmonids. Simulations involved changing the relative abundance of habitat suitable for two juvenile size classes (small fry and larger parr), the type of density-dependent regulation (effects on survival only vs. effects on survival and growth) and intercohort competitive mechanisms. 3. Increased breeding dispersion could alter patterns of density-dependent mortality and increase equilibrium adult abundance and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, there was a strong interaction between stage-specific habitat abundance and breeding dispersion. The most pronounced effects of breeding dispersion were observed under intermediate levels of fry habitat abundance. 4. When fry habitat was abundant, density-dependent mortality was most intense during the parr stage, and increased breeding dispersion did not increase adult abundance or MSY. In fact, when populations were regulated in the parr stage, increased breeding dispersion could cause decreased adult abundance because of the effects of intercohort competition. This negative effect only occurred, however, when competition among juveniles was symmetric (no age or size advantage). 5. Synthesis and applications. The population effects of restoring breeding habitat can differ among environments, and we have demonstrated how these differences can be understood in the light of stage-specific density dependence. Increasing spatial dispersion of breeders may often be an efficient measure for conserving threatened populations and increasing yields in fished populations. However, if direct evidence or habitat considerations suggest that fish populations experience density-dependent mortality during the parr stage, attempts to increase abundance through increased breeding distribution or artificial stocking should be avoided, as these are likely to be ineffective or even detrimental. The difference between fishing rates providing maximum sustainable yield and extinction is particularly small for such populations, suggesting that fish managers should adopt a conservative and flexible regulation regime. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Phenotypic variation in trait means is a common observation for geographically separated populations. Such variation is typically retained under common garden conditions, indicating that there has been evolutionary change in the populations, as a result of selection and/or drift. Much less frequently studied is variation in the phenotypic covariance matrix (hereafter, P matrix), although this is an important component of evolutionary change. In this paper, we examine variation in the phenotypic means and P matrices in two species of grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes and M. devastator. Using the P matrices estimated for 14 populations of M. sanguinipes and three populations of M. devastator we find that (1) significant differences between the sexes can be attributed to scaling effects; (2) there is no significant difference between the two species; (3) there are highly significant differences among populations that cannot be accounted for by scaling effects; (4) these differences are a consequence of statistically significant patterns of covariation with geographic and environmental factors, phenotypic variances and covariances increasing with increased temperature but decreasing with increased latitude and altitude. This covariation suggests that selection has been important in the evolution of the P matrix in these populations Finally, we find a significant positive correlation between the average difference between matrices and the genetic distance between the populations, indicating that drift has caused some of the variation in the P matrices.},

abstract = {A growing push to implement catch share fishery programs is based partly on the recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts of catch share programs were measured through comparisons of fisheries with catch shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio of catch to catch quotas. These impacts of catch shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent of the number of years that catch share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect of catch shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management.},

abstract = {Among vertebrates, there are approximately fifty sperm-dependent asexual species, all of which are of hybrid origin. Sperm-dependent asexual vertebrates use sperm from one, or both, of their parental species for reproduction. To address the hypothesis that selection has resulted in asexual phenotypes that resemble their host's phenotype, I studied size, shape, and genetic variation (using six microsatellite loci) in nine populations of a sperm-dependent asexual fish, Chrosomus eos-neogaeus, in Alberta, Canada. These nine populations differed in the presence or absence of each of the two parental species: three populations coexist with C. eos, two populations coexist with C. neogaeus, and four populations coexist with both parental species. Consistent with my hypothesis, I found that C. eos-neogaeus tended to match the body size of the parental species with which they coexist, and that C. eos-neogaeus that coexist with only C. eos were genetically divergent from C. eos-neogaeus that are syntopic with only C. neogaeus. The genetic divergence among C. eos-neogaeus populations was independent of geographic distance among populations, and estimates of quantitative trait divergence among C. eos-neogaeus populations exceeded neutral expectations. These observations suggest that processes other than migration, mutation, and drift are likely shaping the diversity of C. eos-neogaeus in the lakes sampled for this study. For example, sexual selection leading to host mimicry, or natural selection leading to environmental adaptation, may explain the observed pattern of host-size matching.},

Indicators of effect include: water quality (total suspended solids TSS), physical habitat (substrate particle size, channel morphology), benthic invertebrate community structure and drift (abundance, species composition, diversity, standing crop), and fish behavior and physiology (hierarchy, feeding, respiration rate, loss of equilibrium, blood hematocrit and leukocrit levels, heart rate and stroke volume).

To answer these questions, we used two indices of improvement: (i) monitoring effort and (ii) abundance of spawning adults. Our results, based on data for all species from British Columbia's north and central coasts, show that monitoring effort has continued to erode, abundance of spawning adults has significantly declined for several species, the status of many salmon Conservation Units are in zones of concern, and 42% of the Conservation Units that we assessed as Red (threatened) would have improved in status had the Canadian fishery been reduced.

Catch-and-release fisheries\nwith low mortality can maintain quality close to large cities, whereas\nhigher release mortality does not prevent collapse. Direct fishing\neffort limitation can maintain quality fisheries, but a high\nproportional reduction in effort is required to maintain quality near\npopulation centres. Explicit consideration of the location of fisheries\nwithin lake districts is necessary to design effective management\napproaches and will likely require a mixed strategy with substantial\nspatial variation in harvest control.},

abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

abstract = {In many areas of the world, recreational fisheries are not managed sustainably. This might be related to the omission or oversimplification of angler behaviour and angler heterogeneity in fisheries-management models. We present an integrated bioeconomic modelling approach to examine how differing assumptions about angler behaviour, angler preferences, and composition of the angler population altered predictions about optimal recreational-fisheries management, where optimal regulations were determined by maximizing aggregated angler utility. We report four main results derived for a prototypical northern pike (Esox lucius) fishery. First, accounting for dynamic angler behaviour changed predictions about optimal angling regulations. Second, optimal input and output regulations varied substantially among different angler types. Third, the composition of the angler population in terms of angler types was important for determining optimal regulations. Fourth, the welfare measure used to quantify aggregated utility altered the predicted optimal regulations, highlighting the importance of choosing welfare measures that closely reflect management objectives. A further key finding was that socially optimal angling regulations resulted in biological sustainability of the fish population. Managers can use the novel integrated modelling framework introduced here to account, quantitatively and transparently, for the diversity and complexity of angler behaviour when determining regulations that maximize social welfare and ensure biological sustainability.},

These include, but are not limited to, full (100%) independent dockside monitoring, full video capture of fishing events and vessel monitoring at sea, 10% partial review of the video imagery from each trip, and full coverage of fisher logbooks. The monitoring also relies on complete retention of the over 30 species of rockfish (Sebastes spp.). Each component, in spite of its weaknesses as a stand-alone monitoring tool, makes an essential contribution without which the overall programme would fail. The programme has surpassed expectations in providing accurate, defensible, and timely estimates of total catch for all quota and many non-quota species. This document summarizes contextual and process ingredients, which contributed to implementation, the key being a "carrot and stick" approach wherein industry support was facilitated by the "carrot" of coincident full introduction of individual vessel quotas (ITQs). The "stick" was that Government support was conditional on improving catch monitoring with the proviso that ITQs would not be considered and the fishery would be closed until the monitoring was improved. Also important was the fact that previous failures to solve management and catch monitoring in this fishery with overly simple solutions had created an understanding by all participants that an effective and lasting solution would be complex and require a major commitment of time and funds.},

This review examines the effects of crossing construction on fish and fish habitat in rivers and streams, and recommends an approach to monitoring and assessment of impacts associated with these activities. Pipeline crossing construction is shown to not only compromise the integrity of the physical and chemical nature of fish habitat, but also to affect biological habitat (e.g., benthic invertebrates and invertebrate drift), and fish behavior and physiology. Indicators of effect include: water quality (total suspended solids TSS), physical habitat (substrate particle size, channel morphology), benthic invertebrate community structure and drift (abundance, species composition, diversity, standing crop), and fish behavior and physiology (hierarchy, feeding, respiration rate, loss of equilibrium, blood hematocrit and leukocrit levels, heart rate and stroke volume). The Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach, which is often applied in Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM), is recommended as a basis for impact assessment, as is consideration of site-specific sensitivities, assessment of significance, and cumulative effects.},

abstract = {Establishment of marine protected areas, including fully protected marine reserves, is one of the few management tools available for local communities to combat the deleterious effect of large scale environmental impacts, including global climate change, on ocean ecosystems. Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection.},

abstract = {Changing climate is predicted to impact all depths of the global oceans, yet projections of range shifts in marine faunal distributions in response to changing climate seldom evaluate potential shifts in depth distribution. Marine ectotherms' thermal tolerance is limited by their ability to maintain aerobic metabolism (oxygen- and capacity-limited tolerance), and is functionally associated with their hypoxia tolerance. Shallow-water (<200 m depth) marine invertebrates and fishes demonstrate limited tolerance of increasing hydrostatic pressure (pressure exerted by the overlying mass of water), and hyperbaric (increased pressure) tolerance is proposed to depend on the ability to maintain aerobic metabolism, too. Here, we report significant correlation between the hypoxia thresholds and the hyperbaric thresholds of taxonomic groups of shallow-water fauna, suggesting that pressure tolerance is indeed oxygen limited. Consequently, it appears that the combined effects of temperature, pressure and oxygen concentration constrain the fundamental ecological niches (FENs) of marine invertebrates and fishes. Including depth in a conceptual model of oxygen- and capacity-limited FENs' responses to ocean warming and deoxygenation confirms previous predictions made based solely on consideration of the latitudinal effects of ocean warming (e.g. Cheung et al., 2009), that polar taxa are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with Arctic fauna experiencing the greatest FEN contraction. In contrast, the inclusion of depth in the conceptual model reveals for the first time that temperate fauna as well as tropical fauna may experience substantial FEN expansion with ocean warming and deoxygenation, rather than FEN maintenance or contraction suggested by solely considering latitudinal range shifts.},

abstract = {1. It has been suggested that the habitats which a species occupies can be divided into sources and sinks, depending on whether or not local reproduction is sufficient to balance mortality. Source populations are those where reproduction exceeds mortality, surplus individuals dispersing to sink populations where mortality exceeds local reproduction. Sink populations would not be viable in the absence of immigration. 2. A difference equation model is constructed to show that sources and sinks cannot be identified from a simple comparison of the demographic rates between populations, as measured by the numbers of births and deaths. 3. Viable populations may appear to be non-viable simply because the dispersal of individuals into them depresses fecundity or increases mortality as a result of density-dependence. The consequence is that local recruitment appears insufficient to balance local mortality. 4. Viable populations that appear as sinks, as a result of the dispersal of individuals into them, are termed here as `pseudo-sinks'. They will clearly be difficult to distinguish from genuine sinks on the basis of a simple comparison of the numbers of births and deaths in different populations. 5. Examples of source and genuine sink populations and the data required to establish them are discussed.},

abstract = {No-take marine reserves are widely recognized as an effective conservation tool for protecting marine resources. Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of fished species increase within marine reserve boundaries, the potential for reserves to provide fisheries and conservation benefits to adjacent waters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection, but at relatively small scales, detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries. At these small scales, local fisheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve, and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger-scale fished stocks, networks of reserves may be necessary, but as few exist this is difficult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and benefit local fisheries adjacent to their boundaries.},

Catch-and-release regulations designed to protect fisheries may fail to halt population declines, particularly in situations where fishing effort is high and when multiple stressors threaten a population. We demonstrate this claim using Alberta's Bow River, which supports a high-effort rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fishery where anglers voluntarily release >99% of their catch. We examined the population trend of adult trout, which were tagged and recaptured using electro-fishing surveys conducted intermittently during 2003–2013. We constructed Bayesian multisession capture–recapture models in Stan to obtain abundance estimates for trout and regressed trend during two periods to account for variation in sampling locations. General patterns from all models indicated the population declined throughout the study. Potential stressors to this system that may have contributed to the decline include whirling disease (Myxobolus cerebralis), which was detected for the first time in 2016, notable floods, and release mortality. Because disease and floods are largely uncontrollable from a management perspective, we suggest that stringent tactics such as angler effort restrictions may be necessary to maintain similar fisheries.},

abstract = {Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) are known to diversify into two forms specialized for foraging on either limnetic or littoral prey. Because juvenile bluegills seek vegetative cover in the presence of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) predators, natural selection should favor the littoral body design at size ranges most vulnerable to predation. Yet within bluegill populations, both limnetic and littoral forms occur where vegetation and predators are present. While adaptive for foraging in different environments, does habitat-linked phenotypic variation also influence predator evasiveness for juvenile bluegills? We evaluate this question by quantifying susceptibility to predation for two groups of morphologically distinct bluegills; a limnetic form characteristic of bluegills inhabiting open water areas (limnetic bluegill) and a littoral form characteristic of bluegills inhabiting dense vegetation (littoral bluegill). In a series of predation trials, we found that bluegill behaviors differed in open water habitat but not in simulated vegetation. In open water habitat, limnetic bluegills formed more dense shoaling aggregations, maintained a larger distance from the predator, and required longer amounts of time to capture than littoral bluegill. When provided with simulated vegetation, largemouth bass spent longer amounts of time pursuing littoral bluegill and captured significantly fewer littoral bluegills than limnetic fish. Hence, morphological and behavioral variation in bluegills was linked to differential susceptibility to predation in open water and vegetated environments. Combined with previous studies, these findings show that morphological and behavioral adaptations enhance both foraging performance and predator evasiveness in different lake habitats.},

abstract = {Abstract

We present a novel adaptation of the classic discrete delay‐difference model, a continuous delay‐differential model (cDDM), which can adequately represent population dynamics of stocks that turn over rapidly and continuously over time (e.g., small pelagic fish, small tunas, and shrimps). We used the Northern‐Central Peruvian anchoveta stock (
Engraulis ringens
, Engraulidae) as a case study for implementing the cDDM and conducted a management strategy evaluation (MSE) through stochastic optimization in policy space (SOPS). Our results showed that cDDM integrated with SOPS efficiently searches optimum and near‐optimum harvest control rules (HCR) and is an alternative to pre‐setting arbitrary HCRs as in traditional MSE. The cDDM showed comparable stock biomass and recruitment estimate reconstructions to more complex stock assessment models described for anchoveta. We concluded that the anchoveta stock is sustainably managed and is an example of adaptive fisheries management under high ocean‐climate variability and uncertainty. Contrary to fishery textbooks, the anchoveta's collapse was not entirely due to the 1972 El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) but a recruitment failure preceding EN. Our reconstructions revealed that low recruitment (or recruitment failure) could still occur at high stock biomass. Anchoveta's stock biomass is larger than pre‐collapse, likely due to favourable environmental conditions (a cooling trend) and management, despite more frequent and stronger EN events. SOPS quickly revealed that harvest strategies with large base biomass ({\textgreater}5 mmt) lead to higher interannual stock variability and would not produce substantial increases in long‐term yield. Alternative HCRs with lower base biomass, while adjusting for productivity regimes, have similar long‐term yields without affecting the long‐term average stock.},

abstract = {Ecological studies relating population parameters to climate conditions are limited by a lack of experimental control systems and rely instead on correlative evidence to draw inferences about how populations respond to environmental forcing. Consequently, some correlations turn out to be spurious and not ecologically meaningful. To strengthen inferences, multiple populations may be examined simultaneously to confirm whether relationships can be generalized across multiple systems; however, this assumes that populations respond similarly to climate drivers, ignoring the potential for ecological complexity. Using data on eight sockeye salmon populations from southwestern Alaska, we constructed a series of models based on ecological hypotheses, relating salmon population productivity to climate factors experienced at different life stages. We modeled populations at a range of organizational scales, from distinct populations, to populations grouped by common nursery lake, to all populations within a watershed, and determined the relative statistical support for climate drivers at each scale. In general, warmer lake and sea surface temperatures in the summer coincided with increased productivity of these populations, but the most sensitive life-stage for climate effects varied among populations, particularly among nursery lakes. The best model when considering all populations together, despite strong statistical support, failed to represent the complexity which became evident when populations were modeled by common nursery lake, or independently. These results emphasize that the most appropriate organizational scale to model salmon stocks will depend on specific management, scientific, or conservation goals.},

abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

abstract = {The use of remote, baited ‘video fishing' techniques offer standardised, non-extractive methodologies for estimating relative abundance of a range of marine vertebrates and invertebrates, with the option of very precise and accurate length and biomass estimates when stereo-camera pairs are used. They have also been used to monitor the fate of bycatch discards and other food falls, and to help measure metabolic rates, swimming speed and foraging behaviour of abyssal scavengers. This paper gives a brief overview of the general methodology, benefits and limitations of the technique. We conclude that baited video techniques afford the only sampling option for some situations, but more often can complement other traditional methods to enhance the scope and capability of monitoring and stock assessment programs. Major advances will be made when models are developed for shallow waters to estimate absolute density of target species by accounting for the sampling area in the bait plume. Cheaper, better and smaller camera, lighting and deployment systems are inevitable, but focussed research and development is needed to overcome bottlenecks in data acquisition from tapes through incremental automation.},

Populations of both species in Alberta, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Oneida Lake, New York, had density-dependent catchability with approximately tenfold higher catchability in Alberta than in the other regions when density was controlled for. There is no evidence that the higher catchability estimates for Alberta walleye and northern pike are due to differential spatial distributions, enhanced hook avoidance due to catch and release or to differential size structure of the populations, or to differences in harvest regulations.We argue that the most likely explanation for the tenfold higher catchability is increased hunger resulting in enhanced foraging activity in the region with a substantially shorter growing season, lower prey productivity, and lower prey community diversity. Regardless of the proximate causes, higher catchability of fish harvested in recreational fisheries in Alberta substantially increases their vulnerability to overharvest and collapse if angling effort is unabated.},

abstract = {Numerical abundance and biomass values presented here for Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, Chum Salmon O. keta, and Sockeye Salmon O. nerka in the North Pacific Ocean span 90 years (1925–2015), representing the most comprehensive compilation of these data to date. In contrast to less populous species of salmon, these species are more abundant now than ever, averaging 665 × 106 adult salmon each year (1.32 × 106 metric tons) during 1990–2015. When immature salmon are included, recent biomass estimates approach 5 × 106 metric tons. Following an initial peak during 1934–1943, abundances were low until the 1977 regime shift benefited each species. During 1990–2015, Pink Salmon dominated adult abundance (67% of total) and biomass (48%), followed by Chum Salmon (20%, 35%) and Sockeye Salmon (13%, 17%). Alaska produced approximately 39% of all Pink Salmon, 22% of Chum Salmon, and 69% of Sockeye Salmon, while Japan and Russia produced most of the remainder. Although production of natu- ral-origin salmon is currently high due to generally favorable ocean conditions in northern regions, approximately 60% of Chum Salmon, 15% of Pink Salmon, and 4% of Sockeye Salmon during 1990–2015 were of hatchery origin. Alaska generated 68% and 95% of hatchery Pink Salmon and Sockeye Salmon, respectively, while Japan produced 75% of hatchery Chum Salmon. Salmon abundance in large areas of Alaska (Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska), Russia (Sakhalin and Kuril islands), Japan, and South Korea are dominated by hatchery salmon. During 1990–2015, hatchery salmon represented approximately 40% of the total biomass of adult and immature salmon in the ocean. Density-dependent effects are apparent, and carrying capacity may have been reached in recent decades, but interaction effects between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon are difficult to quantify, in part because these fish are rarely separated in catch and escapement statistics. The following management changes are recommended: (1) mark or tag hatchery salmon so that they can be identified after release, (2) estimate hatchery- and natural-origin sal- mon in catches and escapement, and (3) maintain these statistics in publicly accessible databases.

Postlogging soil erosion and vegetal regeneration success were assessed by measuring soil depth, percent bare rock and moss cover, and the numbers and diversity of trees, shrubs, and plants on 25 sampling sites, each containing ten measuring quadrats selected at random. Sixteen sites were on the Quatsino Formation, a well-karstified limestone, and nine on the Karmutsen Formation of basaltic lavas. Eight sites were of virgin forest, 16 were logged between 1970 and 1983, and one (on limestone) was logged in 1911. Both bedrock types were significantly affected by the cutting. There was greater loss of soil and an increase in bare rock on the limestones. Erosion was increased significantly by burning on the limestones but not on the volcanics. Within-group comparisons on the limestones determined that steeper slopes and harder burned areas suffered the most and are slowest to regenerate. Volume of timber on the 1911 site was 19 percent of that in similar uncut forest sites. It appears that complete recovery on the barren limestone slopes will require at least some centuries. {\textcopyright} 1993 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {* Landscape-scale clines in environmental parameters can lead to life-history gradients. Study of interspecific life-history differences can provide evidence of evolutionary adaptations in response to environmental cues, whereas examination of intraspecific life-history variation can identify the ecological mechanisms driving trait evolution.


* We examined egg size and fecundity variation in three species of closely related freshwater fish (Galaxiidae) which occur across a habitat gradient in South Island, New Zealand. Inter-population trait variation was assessed in the species with the widest distribution to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving egg size evolution.


* Substantial interspecific egg size and fecundity differences were observed. Galaxias paucispondylus, which generally occurs in high altitude headwater streams, showed an average egg size an order of magnitude larger, and fecundity an order of magnitude lower than G. brevipinnis, a species which rears in pelagic environments. Galaxias vulgaris, which rears fluvial environments but is generally distributed in lower catchment reaches than G. paucispondylus, showed intermediate fecundity and egg size traits. This interspecific trait variation is likely to be driven by differences in the larval rearing habitat, i.e. rearing in cold high altitude locations requires large well-developed larvae (and therefore large eggs) but these come at the cost of maternal fecundity, whereas in rearing in warmer lower catchment watercourses, and pelagic habitats, does not require such large well-developed larvae. Hence, fitness is maximised by progressively increasing fecundity by reducing egg size across this habitat cline.


* Life history-habitat trends were repeated when intraspecific patterns in the widely distributed G. vulgaris were assessed, with population egg size increasing, and fecundity decreasing, in relation to a suite of interrelated environmental variables up an approximate altitudinal cline.


* The results highlight how inter- and intraspecific variation in egg size–fecundity trade-offs in closely related species can interact to drive the evolution of landscape-scale life-history gradients. Egg size differences are likely to be driven by differences in the quality of the larval rearing habitat, i.e. rearing in a challenging habitat requires a larger egg whereas in relatively benign larval rearing habitat, fecundity can be maximised by reducing egg size. The interspecific variation observed provides evidence of trait adaptation in response to an environmental cue, while the intraspecific inter-population differences indicate the potential ecological mechanisms driving trait evolution.},

There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters. However, under other circumstances, no such changes may take place in particular parameters, or they may occur in a different direction, with limitation still occurring. This suggests that (i) little about range limitation can categorically be inferred from many empirical studies, which document change in only one demographic parameter, (ii) there is a need for studies that document variation in all of the parameters, and (iii) in agreement with theoretical evidence that range limits can be formed in the presence or absence of hard boundaries, environmental gradients or biotic interactions, there may be few general patterns as to the determinants of these limits, with most claimed generalities at least having many exceptions.},

abstract = {The recently formulated metabolic theory of ecology has profound implications for the evolution of life histories. Metabolic rate constrains the scaling of production with body mass, so that larger organisms have lower rates of production on a mass-specific basis than smaller ones. Here, we explore the implications of this constraint for life-history evolution. We show that for a range of very simple life histories, Darwinian fitness is equal to birth rate minus death rate. So, natural selection maximizes birth and production rates and minimizes death rates. This implies that decreased body size will generally be favored because it increases production, so long as mortality is unaffected. Alternatively, increased body size will be favored only if it decreases mortality or enhances reproductive success sufficiently to override the preexisting production constraint. Adaptations that may favor evolution of larger size include niche shifts that decrease mortality by escaping predation or that increase fecundity by exploiting new abundant food sources. These principles can be generalized to better understand the intimate relationship between the genetic currency of evolution and the metabolic currency of ecology.},

They are also urgently needed as countries work to define marine protected areas. Current approaches are time consuming, focus largely on grain size, and tend to overlook shallow waters. Our random forest classification of almost 200,000 observations of bottom type is a timely alternative, providing maps of coastal substrate at a combination of resolution and extents not previously achieved. We correlated the observations with depth, depth-derivatives, and estimates of energy to predict marine substrate at 100 m resolution for Canada's Pacific shelf, a study area of over 135,000 km2. We built five regional models with the same data at 20 m resolution. In addition to standard tests of model fit, we used three independent data sets to test model predictions. We also tested for regional, depth, and resolution effects. We guided our analysis by asking: 1) does weighting for prevalence improve model predictions? 2) does model resolution influence model performance? And 3) is model performance influenced by depth? All our models fit the build data well with true skill statistic (TSS) scores ranging from 0.56 to 0.64. Weighting models with class prevalence improved fit and the correspondence with known spatial features. Class-based metrics showed differences across both resolutions and spatial regions, indicating non-stationarity across these spatial categories. Predictive power was lower (TSS from 0.10 to 0.36) based on independent data evaluation. Model performance was also a function of depth and resolution, illustrating the challenge of accurately representing heterogeneity. Our work shows the value of regional analyses to assessing model stationarity and how independent data evaluation and the use of error metrics can improve understanding of model performance and sampling bias.},

B&A rule of thumb: If ratio of n/K < 40, then use bias adjustment: AIC c = -2*ln(likelihood) + 2*K + (2*K*(K+1))/(n-K-1) where variables are as defined above. Notice that as the size of the dataset, n, increases relative to the number of parameters, K, the bias adjustment term on the right becomes very, very small. Therefore, it is recommended that you always use the small sample adjustment.

abstract = {The complex structure of seagrass beds provides increased protection for prey com- pared to unvegetated substrates. Additionally, most studies support the notion that predation inten- sity is negatively correlated with seagrass density. However, virtually every study to previously test this idea has used the same number of predators and prey across a gradient of seagrass density treat- ments. This design ignores another well-established fact: invertebrate and fish abundance increase with increasing seagrass density. Therefore, it makes sense to carry out predation experiments that increase the number of both predators and prey as seagrass density increases. Outdoor tank experi- ments (7 density treatments: 0 to 3000 leaves m–2) were carried out using artificial seagrass units modeled after turtlegrass Thalassia testudinum and field mesocosm experiments (4 density treat- ments: 0 to 3000 leaves m–2) in living T. testudinum in Big Lagoon (Florida, USA). In these experi- ments the absolute number of predators (the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides) and prey (grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio) were increased with increasing seagrass density. Both experiments yielded similar results: the only significant difference in predation rate was between the unvegetated treat- ment and the seagrass treatments as a group. These results suggest that dense seagrass does not nec- essarily provide increased protection for prey organisms.},

Most existing analyses suggest overfishing is increasing, and there is widespread concern that fish stocks are decreasing throughout most of the world. We assembled trends in abundance and harvest rate of stocks that are scientifically assessed, constituting half of the reported globalmarine fish catch. For these stocks, on average, abundance is increasing and is at proposed target levels. Compared with regions that are intensively managed, regions with less-developed fisheries management have, on average, 3-fold greater harvest rates and half the abundance as assessed stocks. Available evidence suggests that the regions without assessments of abundance have little fisheries management, and stocks are in poor shape. Increased application of area-appropriate fisheries science recommendations and management tools are still needed for sustaining fisheries in places where they are lacking.},

We examined how intraspecific variation in thermal niches and pheno-typic plasticity will affect species distributions in a warming climate. We first developed a conceptual model linking plasticity and niche breadth, providing five alternative intraspecific sce-narios that are consistent with existing literature. Secondly, we used ecological niche-modeling techniques to quantify the impact of each intraspecific scenario on the distribution of a virtual species across a geographically realistic setting. Finally, we performed an analogous modeling exercise using real data on the climatic niches of different tree provenances. We show that when population differentiation is accounted for and dispersal is restricted, forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are even more pessimistic than those using the conventional assump-tion of homogeneously high plasticity across a species' range. Suitable population-level data are not available for most species so identifying general patterns of population differentiation could fill this gap. However, the literature review revealed contrasting patterns among species, urging greater levels of integration among empirical, modeling and theoretical research on intraspecific phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {During 19–21 June 2013 a heavy precipitation event affected southern Alberta and adjoining regions, leading to severe flood damage in numerous communities and resulting in the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. This flood was caused by a combination of meteorological and hydrological factors, which are investigated from weather and climate perspectives with the fifth generation Canadian Regional Climate Model. Results show that the contribution of orographic ascent to precipitation was important, exceeding 30 % over the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Another contributing factor was evapotranspiration from the land surface, which is found to have acted as an important moisture source and was likely enhanced by antecedent rainfall that increased soil moisture over the northern Great Plains. Event attribution analysis suggests that human induced greenhouse gas increases may also have contributed by causing evapotranspiration rates to be higher than they would have been under pre-industrial conditions. Frozen and snow-covered soils at high elevations are likely to have played an important role in generating record streamflows. Results point to a doubling of surface runoff due to the frozen conditions, while 25 % of the modelled runoff originated from snowmelt. The estimated return time of the 3-day precipitation event exceeds 50 years over a large region, and an increase in the occurrence of similar extreme precipitation events is projected by the end of the 21st century. Event attribution analysis suggests that greenhouse gas increases may have increased 1-day and 3-day return levels of May–June precipitation with respect to pre-industrial climate conditions. However, no anthropogenic influence can be detected for 1-day and 3-day surface runoff, as increases in extreme precipitation in the present-day climate are offset by decreased snow cover and lower frozen water content in soils during the May–June transition months, compared to pre-industrial climate.},

The goal of this article is to suggest that implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) has to be 'revolutionary' in the sense of going beyond conventional practices. It would require the use of multiple disciplines and multiple objectives, dealing with technically unresolvable management problems of complex adaptive systems and expanding scope from management to governance. Developing the governance toolbox would require expanding into new kinds of interaction unforeseen by the mid-twentieth-century fathers of fishery science - governance that may involve cooperative, multilevel management, partnerships, social learning and knowledge co-production. In addition to incorporating relatively well-known resilience, adaptive management and co-management approaches, taking EBM to the next stage may include some of the following: conceptualizing EBM as a 'wicked problem'; conceptualizing fisheries as social-ecological systems; picking and choosing from an assortment of new governance approaches; and finding creative ways to handle complexity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the past 100 years, the global average temperature has increased by approximately 0.6 °C and is projected to continue to rise at a rapid rate. Although species have responded to climatic changes throughout their evolutionary history, a primary concern for wild species and their ecosystems is this rapid rate of change. We gathered information on species and global warming from 143 studies for our meta-analyses. These analyses reveal a consistent temperature-related shift, or 'fingerprint', in species ranging from molluscs to mammals and from grasses to trees. Indeed, more than 80% of the species that show changes are shifting in the direction expected on the basis of known physiological constraints of species. Consequently, the balance of evidence from these studies strongly suggests that a significant impact of global warming is already discernible in animal and plant populations. The synergism of rapid temperature rise and other stresses, in particular habitat destruction, could easily disrupt the connectedness among species and lead to a reformulation of species communities, reflecting differential changes in species, and to numerous extirpations and possibly extinctions.},

abstract = {Walleye Sander vitreus is one of the most important freshwater commercial and sport fishes in western Canada. It is an intensively managed species that is under considerable harvest pressure, yet little is known about the patterns of genetic variation and diversity of walleyes between connected water bodies and among river basins in this region. We examined the genetic variation of walleyes from 12 lakes in five different river basins of northern Alberta. Each lake contained a genetically distinct walleye subpopulation nested within a larger population of the river basin in which the lake was situated. Differentiation between subpopulations varied (F-ST = 0.05-0.29) and exhibited a broad-scale isolation-by-distance pattern. Patterns of genetic divergence aligned closely with the current hydrogeographical landscape, as subpopulations in the same river basin were more similar than those in different river basins. The clear and distinct pattern of genetic structure is likely to have been generated and maintained by historical vicariance and natal philopatry. Because walleye populations are so clearly genetically structured by hydrogeography in western Canada, these data can be used to monitor population status, assess stocking programs, delineate management units, and enable forensic enforcement of harvest restrictions in this region.},

Population data confirmed that brook trout displaced greenback cutthroat trout at sites where the species occur together. The diets of the two species were different; cutthroat trout consumed more prey items and a wider variety of prey than brook trout. Sympatry did not influence gut fullness or body condition for either species. Predation occurred at low rates that did not account for declines in populations of greenback cutthroat trout.

abstract = {Analysts conducting stock assessments using integrated, age-structured models must discretize length data into a limited number of bins (data bins). Furthermore, some modeling frameworks also allow users to specify a distinct structure for how lengths of fish are represented in the model (model bins). The effect of choices regarding the number and width of these bins on model output is unclear, and these choices are made inconsistently in assessments across regions and species. Here, we used the stock synthesis modeling framework, and the ss3sim stock assessment simulation package, to explore the effects of choices about length discretization on stock assessment performance for three fish life-history types and four data cases. We found that, with all other aspects of a model fixed, increasing the model bin width tended to increase estimates of spawning biomass, but this effect depended on the shape of length-based processes (e.g., growth, maturity, and selectivity). Thus, we suggest analysts using model bins wider than 1 cm explore the effect of this decision on derived management quantities. In the context of estimation, there generally was a predictable tradeoff between estimation accuracy and model run time, with finer model and data bins always improving estimation accuracy and model convergence, but increasing run time. In some cases, wider data bins reduced run time (by up to 50\%) with little sacrifice in model estimation performance, particularly those using conditional age-at-length data. This study identifies key aspects to consider when binning length, and provides pertinent information for stock assessment best practice guidelines.},

abstract = {Techniques for estimation of absolute abundance of wildlife populations have received a lot of attention in recent years. The statistical research has been focused on intensive small-scale studies. Recently, however, wildlife biologists have desired to study populations of animals at very large scales for monitoring purposes. Population indices are widely used in these extensive monitoring programs because they are inexpensive compared to estimates of absolute abundance. A crucial underlying assumption is that the population index (C) is directly proportional to the population density (D). The proportionality constant, $\beta$, is simply the probability of ‘detection' for animals in the survey. As spatial and temporal comparisons of indices are crucial, it is necessary to also assume that the probability of detection is constant over space and time. Biologists intuitively recognize this when they design rigid protocols for the studies where the indices are collected. Unfortunately, however, in many field studies the assumption is clearly invalid. We believe that the estimation of detection probability should be built into the monitoring design through a double sampling approach. A large sample of points provides an abundance index, and a smaller sub-sample of the same points is used to estimate detection probability. There is an important need for statistical research on the design and analysis of these complex studies. Some basic concepts based on actual avian, amphibian, and fish monitoring studies are presented in this article. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Regime shifts between alternative stable ecosystem states are becoming commonplace due to the combined effects of local stressors and global climate change. Alternative states are characterized as substantially different in form and function from pre-disturbance states, disrupting the delivery of ecosystem services and functions. On coral reefs, regime shifts are typically characterized by a change in the benthic composition from coral to macroalgal dominance. Such fundamental shifts in the benthos are anticipated to impact associated fish communities that are reliant on the reef for food and shelter, yet there is limited understanding of how regime shifts propagate through the fish community over time, relative to initial or recovery conditions. This study addresses this knowledge gap using long-term data of coral reef regime shifts and recovery on Seychelles reefs following the 1998 mass bleaching event. It shows how trophic structure of the reef fish community becomes increasingly dissimilar between alternative reef ecosystem states (regime-shifted vs. recovering) with time since disturbance. Regime-shifted reefs developed a concave trophic structure, with increased biomass in base trophic levels as herbivorous species benefitted from increased algal resources. Mid trophic level species, including specialists such as corallivores, declined with loss of coral habitat, while biomass was retained in upper trophic levels by large-bodied, generalist invertivores. Recovering reefs also experienced an initial decline in mid trophic level biomass, but moved toward a bottom-heavy pyramid shape, with a wide range of feeding groups (e.g., planktivores, corallivores, omnivores) represented at mid trophic levels. Given the importance of coral reef fishes in maintaining the ecological function of coral reef ecosystems and their associated fisheries, understanding the effects of regime shifts on these communities is essential to inform decisions that enhance ecological resilience and economic sustainability.},

Study lakes ranged from 2 ha to 271 ha. Trophic status ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. The percentage of lake area covered (PAC) and the percentage of lake volume infested (PVI) with aquatic macrophytes among the lakes ranged from <1% to 100%. Young-of-the-year largemouth bass abundance ranged from 0 to 5857 fish/ha. Subadult largemouth bass abundance ranged from 0 to 216 fish/ha and adult largemouth bass abundance ranged from 1 fish/ha to 75 fish/ha. There were weakly significant, direct relationships among lakes between measures of macrophyte abundance and estimates of young-of-the-year and subadult abundance. There were weakly significant inverse relationships among lakes between measures of macrophyte abundance and growth (mm/day) of age-1 and age-2 largemouth bass. There were no significant relationships among lakes between measures of macrophyte abundance and estimates of adult largemouth bass abundance or standing crop (kg/ha). Adult largemouth bass abundance and standing crop were positively correlated to lake trophic status. After accounting for lake trophic status, the abundance of young-of-the-year largemouth bass was directly related to PVI, and age-1 growth rate was inversely related to PVI but there were no significant relationships between macrophyte abundance and the abundance of subadult and adult largemouth bass. There are no strong predictable relationships between the abundance of aquatic macrophytes and the abundance of adult largemouth bass among Florida lakes < 300 ha.},

abstract = {A time series of mean weekly sea surface temperature (SST) images was used to investigate the relationship between fluctuations in the marine survival of hatchery-reared coho salmon and coastal ocean dynamics off the north-western United States (51°to 37°N) between 1985 and 1996, using univariate and nonlinear bivariate regression analysis. Ocean conditions were matched against survival for a number of different annual time frames according to the sum of negative or positive weekly SST anomalies. From the univariate analyses, the sum of negative anomalies from April to June, when the juvenile salmon first enter the ocean, was found to have an R2 of 0.88 against survival with 1991 excluded as an outlier. The bivariate multiple regressions used the sum of negative anomalies from April to June as the first independent variable. When the sums of positive anomalies from the following periods during the fishes' second calendar year in the ocean were each used as the second independent variable, the R2 values were all greater than or equal to 0.92 (with no data points excluded): January to June, February to June, April to June, March to June. These results are discussed within the context of coastal ocean processes. It is concluded that the analysis of SST image time series might allow management to make reasonable forecasts of hatchery-reared coho salmon survival.},

abstract = {In recent years, evidence for interindividual variation in "personality" within animal populations has been accumulating. Personality is defined as consistency in an individual's behavioral responses over time and/or across situations. One personality trait that has potentially far-reaching implications for behavioral ecology, and may provide insight into the mechanisms by which consistent behavioral correlations arise, is that of boldness. Boldness is defined as the tendency of an individual to take risks and be exploratory in novel contexts. Using the framework of behavioral syndromes, we tested for individual differences in boldness in the laboratory among field-caught juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) within and across the contexts of exploratory behavior, activity, and risk taking (e.g., antipredator) behavior. After such testing, individuals were tagged and returned to their lake of origin as part of a mark-recapture study testing for the repeatability of individual differences in boldness. Here, we report strong and consistent individual differences in boldness within and across all 3 behavioral contexts. Additionally, we observed that at least some boldness behaviors were repeatable after a 1-3 month recapture period. This study provides novel evidence for a boldness syndrome in sunfish, as well as insight into how behavioral types (e.g., shy/bold) may evolve and be maintained in natural populations.},

abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis can be a useful method for improving estimation of key parameters for harvested fish populations. In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

abstract = {Fast and slow life histories are proposed to covary with consistent individual differences in behaviour, but little is known whether it holds in the wild, where individuals experience natural fluctuations of the environment. We investigated whether individual differences in behaviour, such as movement traits and prey selection, are linked to variation in life-history traits in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in the wild. Using high-resolution acoustic telemetry, we collected the positional data of fish in a whole natural lake and estimated individual movement traits by fitting a two-state correlated random walk model. Prey selection was inferred from stable isotope analysis using scale samples. Life-history traits were estimated by fitting a biphasic growth model to an individual growth trajectory back-calculated from scale samples. Life-history traits were correlated with behavioural traits such as movements and prey selection. Individuals with higher reproductive effort were found to switch more frequently between active and inactive modes and show greater reliance on prey from pelagic pathways (indicated by lower $\delta$13C). Further, individuals with faster juvenile growth were found to stay active for a longer time during the adult stage. Our results demonstrate the link between individual behavioural differences and fast–slow life-history traits under ecologically relevant conditions.},

abstract = {Pacific herring Clupea pallasii spawn in nearshore areas in late winter to early spring, but factors influencing the timing and spatial distribution of spawning are not well known. We modeled the temporal and spatial distribution of spawning for 5 herring stocks in British Columbia from egg deposition surveys conducted from 1988−2018 using different sets of environmental predictors and modeling methods. Random forest modeling showed that the timing of spawning in each year was mainly influenced by the number of daylight hours being >10.5, cumulative degree days >100 and salinity at 30.5. The spatial distribution of spawning tended to occur at consistent locations over time. Results showed that the probability of spawning occurring at a transect in a given year was largely determined by the biomass of herring and location of the transect relative to the center of spawning. Environmental factors at individual transects played a much smaller role in determining spawn distribution. There was mixed evidence for spatial expansion of spawning distribution in years of high biomass, with some stocks, such as Haida Gwaii, showing no expansion of the spawning area in years of higher biomass. Since Pacific herring recruitment has been linked to their ability to time larval hatch to spring bloom timing, future warming temperatures may result in earlier herring spawning relative to the spring bloom. This will increase the probability of mismatch with prey, impacting larval herring starvation, growth and perhaps mortality, leading to reductions in recruitment to these important stocks.},

From 2015–2024, seventeen First Nations, the Province of British Columbia, and the Government of Canada collaboratively developed a Network Action Plan to establish an MPA Network for the Northern Shelf Bioregion (NSB). The NSB is a diverse and complex social-ecological region in British Columbia that spans an area of 102,000 km2 from Northern Vancouver Island to the Alaska border. Here, we describe the MPA Network planning process and the transition from Network planning to implementation. We discuss key elements of success that enabled the Network Action Plan's collaborative development and lessons learned to inform and improve regional MPA Network implementation and global MPA Network planning and implementation. All phases of the planning process, including governance, development, engagement, design, and analysis, were guided by the following principles: collaborative governance, multiple ways of knowing, participatory engagement, and adaptation to new information. The Network Action Plan's dynamic design process resulted in innovative approaches and tools to protect conservation objectives throughout the NSB. As the NSB MPA Network process transitions from planning toward implementation, collaborative governance, network monitoring, and ongoing participatory engagement processes will play a central role in advancing the goals and objectives articulated in the Network Action Plan and ensuring equitable social-ecological outcomes. Overall, the NSB MPA Network planning process provides a model for collaborative design of MPA Networks and can inform co-governance and co-management processes throughout the world.},

abstract = {Recreational angling has been implicated in population declines of some marine and freshwater fish, but this activity is rarely considered as a threat or even halted when endangered species are targeted. Indeed, in some cases, anglers are drawn to fish for rare or endangered species. Conservation-oriented behaviours such as catch-and-release are often practiced voluntarily due to the ethics of anglers, yet even in these cases, some fishing mortality occurs. Nonetheless, there are many indirect conservation benefits associated with recreational angling. Here, we pres- ent a series of case-studies and consider whether catch-and-release angling forendangered fish is a conservation problem or a conservation action. If recreational angling activities contribute to population-level consequences that are contrary to recovery strategies, then angling for endangered species would seem to be a poor option. However, as revealed by several case-studies, there is much evidence that anglers are vocal and effective proponents of fish and habitat conservation, and for endangered species, they are often the only voice when other stakeholders are not engaged. Anglers may contribute directly to conservation actions via user fees (e.g. licences), philanthropic donations or by volunteering in research, education and restoration activities. However, it is important to quantify post-release mortality as well as understand the full suite of factors influencing a given population or species to know the potential risks. A risk assessment approach outlined in the paper may be used by managers to determine when the benefits of angling for endangered spe- cies outweigh the risks.},

abstract = {Survival rates and carrying capacities for larval and juvenile fishes may be strongly affected by long-term, unpredictable climatic fluctuations. When climate impacts produce strongly autocorrelated interannual variations in recruitment, harvesting a constant fraction of the stock each year allows the spawning stock to track such variations. Dynamic programming analysis indicates that this tracking effect is likely to produce long-term harvests that are very close (within 15%) to the theoretical optimum that could be achieved if all future climatic variations were known in advance. Fixed harvest rate strategies are likely to degrade performance more than 10% only when there is little interannual correlation in environmental effects or when there is a large, abrupt climate change that can be predicted well in advance if it is going to increase carrying capacity, or detected immediately if it causes a decrease in capacity. This finding implies that it may be more cost effective to invest in research on how to implement fixed harvest rate strategies than to invest in research on explaining and predicting climatic effects. Successful implementation may require a combination of improved stock size assessments, and stringent regulatory measures to substantially restrict the proportion of fish at risk to fishing each year.},

abstract = {The utility of marine protected areas (MPAs) as a means of protecting exploited species and conserving biodiversity within MPA boundaries is supported by strong empirical evidence. However, the potential contribution of MPAs to fished populations beyond their boundaries is still highly controversial; empirical measures are scarce and modelling studies have produced a range of predictions, including both positive and negative effects. Using a combination of genetic parentage and relatedness analysis, we measured larval subsidies to local fisheries replenishment for Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus: Sparidae) from a small (5.2 km2), well-established, temperate, coastal MPA in northern New Zealand. Adult snapper within the MPA contributed an estimated 10.6% (95% CI: 5.5–18.1%) of newly settled juveniles to surrounding areas (approx. 400 km2), with no decreasing trend in contributions up to 40 km away. Biophysical modelling of larval dispersal matched experimental data, showing larvae produced inside the MPA dispersed over a comparable distance. These results demonstrate that temperate MPAs have the potential to provide recruitment subsidies at magnitudes and spatial scales relevant to fisheries management. The validated biophysical model provides a cost-efficient opportunity to generalize these findings to other locations and climate conditions, and potentially informs the design of MPA networks for enhancing fisheries management.},

abstract = {Parametric and nonparametric kernel methods dominate studies of animal home ranges and space use. Most existing methods are unable to incorporate information about the underlying physical environment, leading to poor performance in excluding areas that are not used. Using radio-telemetry data from sea otters, we developed and evaluated a new algorithm for estimating home ranges (hereafter Permissible Home Range Estimation, or “PHRE”) that reflects habitat suitability. We began by transforming sighting locations into relevant landscape features (for sea otters, coastal position and distance from shore). Then, we generated a bivariate kernel probability density function in landscape space and back-transformed this to geographic space in order to define a permissible home range. Compared to two commonly used home range estimation methods, kernel densities and local convex hulls, PHRE better excluded unused areas and required a smaller sample size. Our PHRE method is applicable to species whose ranges are restricted by complex physical boundaries or environmental gradients and will improve understanding of habitat-use requirements and, ultimately, aid in conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Global climate change occurs not only at the ocean surface but also at the ocean bottom, which is the main habitat of demersal fish. To clarify the current status of bottom temperature warming off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, we examined gridded bottom temperature fields from 2003 to 2019. These fields were created by a newly developed gridding method using flexible Gaussian filter weighting with time, distance, and depth. Spatially averaged bottom temperature had a strong, significant warming trend of 0.083 to 0.115°C yr−1 in depth zones of 150−300 m, indicating bottom temperature warming. Corresponding to the warming, increases in landing amounts were found for warm-water species such as searobin in the middle region of our study area (37° 50'−39° N). Seasonal catch amounts suggest that ribbon fish and swimming crab recently began to overwinter and reproduce in the area. The distribution shifts of non-target species in fisheries were also analyzed using bottom otter trawl survey data from the area from 2003 to 2019. Northward distribution shifts and increases in density were observed in blackbelly lantern shark and bighand grenadier, indicating that bottom temperature warming led to habitat expansion. Conversely, darkfin sculpin and jelly eelpout shifted northward with decreasing density, suggesting that bottom temperature warming had a negative effect on them. Deepsea bonefish shifted deeper into colder waters with increasing density and mean body weight. Thus, changes and responses of demersal fish to bottom temperature warming in the area were revealed.},

Ideally, identifying trade-offs between competing objectives involves evaluating management alternatives with a quantitative model that integrates information on both species, but data are often limited. We used new predator diet data and simulation modeling to update our understanding of seal predation on juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Puget Sound. Under prey size assumptions used by previous studies, estimates suggest predation could be a significant source of mortality for Chinook salmon (mean: 37% of ocean age-0 juveniles), but varied considerably among years (range of median estimates: 22%–49%). However, when we estimated prey size from otoliths recovered from seal scats, the impact (numbers of fish consumed) decreased by 71%. Predation on coho salmon was estimated to be relatively low under both scenarios (6%–8% of ocean age-0 juveniles) with a 21% decrease in consumption using otolith-derived prey size. Our analysis highlights the importance of updating model inputs and re-evaluating assumptions of multi-species models used for ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

This truism implies that fisheries science inherently involves disciplines that focus on fish and their population dynamics, humans and their behaviour, and policy and decision making. This is particularly true for recreational fisheries, where the human behavioural motivation and human response to management actions may be more difficult to predict than in commercial fisheries. We provide a synthesis of the multi-disciplinary literature on modelling recreational angler behaviour to inform management of recreational fisheries. We begin by defining the recreational fisheries system in an interdisciplinary manner. We then assess the literature for empirical evidence of disciplinary crossover. Using bibliometric data, we provide evidence that there is little disciplinary crossover, particularly between fisheries biology, including applied ecology, and quantitative social science, including economics. We identify critical barriers to disciplinary crossover, such as database indexing issues and nomenclature. Next, we provide a review of critical contributions to the literature, and locate these contributions within our interdisciplinary conceptualization of the recreational fisheries system. This synthesis is intended to be a cross-disciplinary bridge to facilitate access to the broader literature on modelling angler behaviour, with the ultimate goal of improving recreational fisheries management.},

Selection of coarse clean substrate appears to be of primary importance for successful reproduction.

A variety of behavioral stimuli and cues (e.g., chemosensory cues, memory of site, kin recognition) also have the potential of influencing spawning site selection and may ultimately contribute to sympatric stock separation. Overall, the species appears to be rather adaptable and able to colonize new environments that satisfy basic habitat requirements.

However, the claims of some analysts that there is an inevitable decline in the status of fisheries is, we believe, incorrect. There have been successes in fisheries management, and we argue that the tools for appropriate management exist. Unfortunately, they have not been implemented widely.

By defining the strategies and payoffs for habitat selection, this article puts the IFD concept in a more general game-theoretic setting of the "habitat selection game". Within this game-theoretic framework, the article focuses on recent progress in the following directions: (1) studying evolutionarily stable dispersal rates and corresponding dispersal dynamics; (2) extending the concept when population numbers are not fixed but undergo population dynamics; (3) generalizing the IFD to multiple species. For a single species, the article briefly reviews existing results. It also develops a new perspective for Parker's matching principle, showing that this can be viewed as the IFD of the habitat selection game that models consumer behavior in several resource patches and analyzing complications involved when the model includes resource dynamics as well. For two species, the article first demonstrates that the connection between IFD and ESS is now more delicate by pointing out pitfalls that arise when applying several existing game-theoretic approaches to these habitat selection games. However, by providing a new detailed analysis of dispersal dynamics for predator-prey or competitive interactions in two habitats, it also pinpoints one approach that shows much promise in this general setting, the so-called "two-species ESS". The consequences of this concept are shown to be related to recent studies of population dynamics combined with individual dispersal and are explored for more species or more patches. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The way in which density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal are key in determining the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations. Here we propose a mechanistic approach to understanding how the relative importance of these sources of density dependence can change over ontogeny through changes in dispersal abilities, energy stores and mortality risks. Whereas the potential for active dispersal typically increases over ontogeny as a function of body size, susceptibility to starvation and predation decreases. The joint effect of these mechanisms suggests a general model for the ontogenetic sequence of how density dependence is manifested, with density dependence early in ontogeny being primarily expressed as mortality on local spatial scales, whereas later stages respond to local density in terms of dispersal and potentially growth. Here we test this model by manipulating the densities of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at two life-history stages in the wild. Density-dependent mortality during the early juvenile stage (i.e. fry at onset of exogenous feeding) was accompanied by no effects on body size and weak effects on dispersal. In contrast, dispersal of older juveniles (i.e. parr 2-3 months after onset of feeding) was strongly density-dependent, with more individuals emigrating from high-density release sites, and with no effect of initial density on mortality. This dispersal, however, appeared insufficient to produce an ideal free distribution within the study stream, as indicated by the effect of spatial variation in density on body size by the end of the first growth season. These results demonstrate that the way density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal changes throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, these changes occur in correlation with changes in individual mortality risks and dispersal abilities, and suggest a general paradigm for the way in which juvenile density-dependence is manifest in spatially structured populations of highly fecund organisms.

abstract = {In Lake Superior there are three principal forms of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush): lean, siscowet and humper. Wild lean and siscowet differ in the shape and relative size of the head, size of the fins, location and size of the eyes, caudal peduncle shape and lipid content of the musculature. To investigate the basis for these phenotypic differences, lean and siscowet lake trout, derived from gametes of wild populations in Lake Superior, were reared communally under identical environmental conditions for 2.5 years. Fish were analysed for growth, morphometry and lipid content, and differences in liver transcriptomics were investigated using Roche 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing. The results demonstrate that key phenotypic differences between wild lean and siscowet lake trout such as condition factor, morphometry and lipid levels, persist in these two forms when reared in the laboratory under identical environmental conditions. This strongly suggests that these differences are genetic and not a result of environmental plasticity. Transcriptomic analysis involving the comparison of hepatic gene frequencies (RNA-seq) and expression (quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)) between the two lake trout forms, indicated two primary gene groups that were differentially expressed; those involving lipid synthesis, metabolism and transport (acyl-CoA desaturase, acyl-CoA binding protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and apolipoproteins), and those involved with immunity (complement component C3, proteasome, FK506 binding protein 5 and C1q proteins). The results demonstrate that RNA-seq can be used to identify differentially expressed genes; however, some discrepancies between RNA-seq analysis and qPCR indicate that methods for deep sequencing may need to be refined and/or different RNA-seq platforms utilized.},

abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

abstract = {The Carnation Creek project is a long-term study of the effects of forestry practices on a small coastal watershed (11 km2) located in southwestern Vancouver Island. Initiated in 1970, this pretreatment versus post-treatment case study consists of 5 years of preharvest, 6 years of during-harvest, and now, 34 years of postharvest research. Forty-one percent of the watershed was clearcut from 1976 to 1981. One tributary sub-basin (1.1 km2) was left as an unharvested reference drainage. Riparian treatments varied from clearcuts to a variable-width buffer. Fish population responses to logging have been complex, and specific to species and life stages. Stream warming due partly to riparian harvest increased the growth and survival of juvenile coho salmon and elevated smolt production by 65% for nearly three decades. These relatively short-term thermal benefits offset the effects of riparian clearcutting which included accelerated bank erosion, streambed scour, loss of stable in-stream wood, and sediment movement downstream. Landslides in 1984 greatly amplified these effects but took more than 20 years to propagate downstream to reduce fish habitat complexity and increase streambed instability and sediment transport over the entire portion inhabited by anadromous salmon. These delayed impacts have surpassed the thermal-related benefits for coho salmon. Fry-to-smolt overwinter survival has declined from a mean of 50% between 1982 and 2004 to 15% since 2005. Coho salmon smolt production has consequently been reduced to below prelogging levels. Results show that forestry-related alterations may take decades to fully develop and persist for decades longer without watershed and stream channel restoration.},

abstract = {Humanity faces a major global challenge in achieving wellbeing for all, while simultaneously ensuring that the biophysical processes and ecosystem services that underpin wellbeing are exploited within scientifically informed boundaries of sustainability. We propose a framework for defining the safe and just operating space for humanity that integrates social wellbeing into the original planetary boundaries concept (Rockstr{\"{o}}m et al., 2009a,b) for application at regional scales. We argue that such a framework can: (1) increase the policy impact of the boundaries concept as most governance takes place at the regional rather than planetary scale (2) contribute to the understanding and dissemination of complexity thinking throughout governance and policy-making; (3) act as a powerful metaphor and communication tool for regional equity and sustainability. We demonstrate the approach in two rural Chinese localities where we define the safe and just operating space that lies between an environmental ceiling and a social foundation from analysis of time series drawn from monitored and palaeoecological data, and from social survey statistics respectively. Agricultural intensification has led to poverty reduction, though not eradicated it, but at the expense of environmental degradation. Currently, the environmental ceiling is exceeded for degraded water quality at both localities even though the least well-met social standards are for available piped water and sanitation. The conjunction of these social needs and environmental constraints around the issue of water access and quality illustrates the broader value of the safe and just operating space approach for sustainable development.},

abstract = {In the model described, we attempt to link breeding-site selection to population dynamics for situations in which there is more than one distinct type of habitat. The distribution of individuals between habitat types depends on the selective abilities of the species. This distribution, in turn, influences the population dynamics of the species as a whole. We show that the consequences of habitat selection on population dynamics for an ideal free distribution of individuals across habitats is predictably different from what would be predicted if habitat selection were preemptive, that is, if individuals, upon selecting a site, prevented others from sharing the site. If preemptive selection is ideal, average reproductive success declines with increasing density because each individual selects the best site available from those sites not yet occupied. The model allows us to compare the relative contribution of different types of habitats to a species' growth rate and population size. Furthermore, we can also predict how the loss of habitat of a particular type may affect a population. This should make the model useful for environmental management problems as well as for describing the present distribution of a species across a spatially heterogeneous landscape.},

abstract = {The long-term impacts of large hydroelectric dams on small-scale fisheries in tropical rivers are poorly known. A promising way to investigate such impacts is to compare and integrate the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of resource users with biological data for the same region. We analyzed the accuracy of fishers' LEK to investigate fisheries dynamics and environmental changes in the Lower Tocantins River (Brazilian Amazon) downstream from a large dam. We estimated fishers' LEK through interviews with 300 fishers in nine villages and collected data on 601 fish landings in five of these villages, 22 years after the dam's establishment (2006-2008). We compared these two databases with each other and with data on fish landings from before the dam's establishment (1981) gathered from the literature. The data obtained based on the fishers' LEK (interviews) and from fisheries agreed regarding the primary fish species caught, the most commonly used type of fishing gear (gill nets) and even the most often used gill net mesh sizes but disagreed regarding seasonal fish abundance. According to the interviewed fishers, the primary environmental changes that occurred after the impoundment were an overall decrease in fish abundance, an increase in the abundance of some fish species and, possibly, the local extinction of a commercial fish species (Semaprochilodus brama). These changes were corroborated by comparing fish landings sampled before and 22 years after the impoundment, which indicated changes in the composition of fish landings and a decrease in the total annual fish production. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that large dams may adversely affect small-scale fisheries downstream and establish a feasible approach for applying fishers' LEK to fisheries management, especially in regions with a low research capacity. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Environmental protection strategies often rely on environmental impact assessments. As part of the assessment process biologists are routinely asked to evaluate the effects of management actions on plants and animals. This evaluation often requires that biologists make judgments about the viability of affected populations. However, population viability analyses that are analytically comprehensive require extensive ecological data. Such data are usually unavailable and impossible for wildlife managers to collect given limitations of time and money. In this paper we present a conceptual framework to help managers assess population viability given the reality of limited information and resources. Our framework includes a series of steps that facilitate assessment of management impacts on population viability while stressing the importance of reconciling disparties between the geographic scale of management actions and the scale of ecological responses. We argue that a gross mismatch of scale between local management actions (e.g., timber sales) and geographically extensive ecological responses (e.g., species viability) reduces the reliability of environmental analyses. Our framework stresses "biological populations" as the most appropriate level of ecological organization for conducting impact analyses. We argue that in most cases environmental analyses of local management actions should assess the ecological responses of populations rather than the responses of entire species, as is now commonly the case. We also present ecological concepts that have been used effectively by biologists in making judgments about management effects and in developing conservation plans. Although not completely generalizable we believe these concepts, summarized from the conservation biolgoy literature, can aid in evalluating population viability: (1) connected habitats are better than disjointed habitats; (2) suitable habitats in close proximity to one another are better than widely separated habitats: (3) late states of forest development are often better than younger stages; (4) populations with higher reproductive rates are more secure than those with lower reproductive rates; and (6) environmental conditions that reduce carrying capacity or increase variance in the growth rates of populations decrease persistance probabilities.},

Recent salmon abundance in the northern North Pacific Ocean, as indexed by commercial catches, has been among the highest on record, with no indication of decline; the 2009 catch was the highest to date. Although the North Pacific Ocean continues to produce large quantities of Pacific salmon, temporal abundance patterns vary among species and areas. Currently, pink and chum salmon are very abundant overall and Chinook and coho salmon are less abundant than they were previously, whereas sockeye salmon abundance varies among areas. Analyses confirm climate-related shifts in abundance, associated with reported ecosystem regime shifts in approximately 1947, 1977, and 1989. We found little evidence to support a major shift after 1989. From 1990, generally favourable climate-related marine conditions in the western North Pacific Ocean, as well as expanding hatchery operations and improving hatchery technologies, are increasing abundances of chum and pink salmon. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, climate-related changes are apparently playing a role in increasing chum and pink salmon abundances and declining numbers of coho and Chinook salmon. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {How do organisms adapt to the differences in temperature and length of the growing season that occur with latitude? Among Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) along the east coast of North America, the length of the first growing season declines by a factor of about 2.5 with increasing latitude. Yet body size at the end of the first growing season does not decline. High-latitude fish must, therefore, grow faster within the growing season than do low-latitude fish. This geographical pattern has a genetic basis. Laboratory experiments on fish from six different locations revealed a latitudinal gradient in the capacity for growth (i.e., maximum growth potential). In two subsequent experiments using fish from Nova Scotia (NS), New York (NY) and South Carolina (SC) that had been separately reared in a common environment for several generations, differences in growth rate among populations were highly significant. The rank order was NS>NY>SC, but the difference among populations depended on temperature. High-latitude fish outperformed those from low latitudes primarily at the high temperatures that low-latitude fish would be expected to experience most often in nature. These results suggest that instead of being adapted for growth at low temperatures, fish from high latitudes are adapted for rapid elevation of growth rate during the brief interval of the year when high temperatures occur. Selection on growth rate results from sizedependent winter mortality: the importance to winter survival of being large increases with latitude but the length of the growing season simultaneously decreases. The end result is countergradient variation in growth rate, a phenomenon that may be much more widespread than currently recognized.},

abstract = {(1) Counts through time were compiled for five sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations in the north-east Pacific Ocean that were below equilibrium density: Attu Island, south-east Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, and central California. Similar data were obtained from the equilibrium density population at Amchitka Island in 1971 and 1986. (2) Shorelines of Attu and Amchitka islands each were divided into forty-five segments, within which lineal (length of shore at mean higher high water) and areal (mean higher high water to the 10-fathom (18.3-m) depth contour) measures were made of the amount of habitat. (3) Rate of increase for the four northern populations was 17-20% year-1. Density- or size-dependent changes in rate of increase could not be demonstrated for any of these populations. The California population, in contrast, has undergone three apparent growth phases: the early 1900s to the mid-1970s when it increased about 5% year-1; the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s when it declined about 5% year-1; and the mid-1980s to 1988 when it increased about 7% year-1. An exponential growth model accounted for 92-98% of the variation in counts through time in all cases. (4) Population increase at Attu Island was achieved largely by range expansion as opposed to increased density. Range expansion in lineal and areal habitat occurred at 11% and 13% year-1, respectively; neither rate was lower (P > 0.25) than the observed rate of increase in numbers of animals counted. (5) Despite similarities in island size and physical environment, the most conservative estimates of population density at Amchitka Island were > 3 X greater than maximum density estimates for Attu Island. (6) Surveys of Amchitka Island from the mid-1930s through the mid-1980s indicate that the population increased to a peak in the 1940s; declined abruptly thereafter; and subsequently increased to a new and higher equilibrium in the 1960s, where it has since remained. (7) These population data, together with information on sea otter foraging and benthic community structure at Attu and Amchitka islands, suggest that multiple population equilibria exist in this system, emanating from complex trophic interactions low in the food web. I hypothesize that the lower population equilibrium is achieved largely or exclusively on an invertebrate diet consisting principally of herbivorous sea urchins. When unregulated by sea otter predation, the rocky benthos is deforested by sea urchin grazing. As growing otter populations compete increasingly for food, grazing intensity declines and the system shifts to one dominated by kelp beds, in turn leading to increased production, a shift in habitat structure, and population increases of kelp bed fishes. Apparently this new food resource elevates the sea otter population to a higher and more stable equilibrium.},

abstract = {Quantitative models have been used extensively to solve complex problems in sea otter conservation. Models represent powerful tools for simplifying and integrating data across a wide range of topics, from behavior and physiology to complex population dynamics, genetics, disease ecology, food-web interactions, and physical/biological oceanography. When based on solid data and sound assumptions, models allow scientists to test hypotheses, elucidate the underlying mechanisms of a particular problem, and make sound conservation decisions. Here I discuss several branches of conservation science in which sea otter researchers have used mathematical models to aid in their research, including behavior, population dynamics, community interactions, and applied conservation questions. For each subject area, I explain some of the key research questions, provide examples of how models have been used to help answer those questions, and highlight promising areas for future and ongoing work in sea otter conservation. Finally I explore some of the general lessons that can be drawn from these examples, focusing on points that may be useful for wildlife conservation more broadly.},

@article{Myers1997,
abstract = {In 1993, six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) had collapsed to the point where a moratorium was declared on fishing. It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment of cod to the fishery. Yet we are unable to detect a difference between the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of 20%. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as determined by research surveys and reconstructed from the commercial catch at age data (called 'virtual population analysis' [VPA]) for each stock. VPA-based abundances consistently depict lower recruitment levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend. One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality. This is consistent with the discarding hypothesis. We suggest that age-specific abundance trends estimated from research surveys and VPA should be compared for all stocks where such data exist, and that high priority should be given to the measurement of discarding levels and the extent to which catch misreporting is related to changes in fishing mortality.},

abstract = {A seven-year study in upper Lake Marion, South Carolina evaluated the response of fishes to hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle) removal by triploid grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella Valenciennes). A boat-mounted electroshocker was used to quantify relative abundance and species composition of fishes at 10 permanent locations distributed throughout the upper lake. A total of 16,306 fish representing 64 species were collected. The taxonomically dominant family was Centrarchidae and the numerically dominant family was Clupeidae. There were significant differences in catch between years with high and low hydrilla coverage. Littoral fishes, especially Centrarchidae, increased as hydrilla decreased from a maximum of 4,700 ha (approximately 50% of the surface area) to less than 100 ha by 1994. Mean lengths of most littoral species were similar during the study Despite substantial declines in hydrilla, other forms of cover persisted during the study providing an intermediate level of structural complexity. Consequently grass carp effectively controlled hydrilla but did not create any detectable negative effects on the littoral fish assemblage during the study},

abstract = {One expects that participation and effort in outdoor recreation activities would be directly related to the quality of available resources. However, this expectation remains a largely untested empirical question. We examined this relationship explicitly by analysing the proportion of the population with freshwater angling licences in 188 different administrative regions of British Columbia, Canada. Variations in the proportion of anglers in the population within a region were explained by resource quality measures, including multiple catch and non-catch related factors (such as stocking and the accessibility of fishing destinations). The proportion of the population holding a fishing licence was greatly affected by physical determinants such as access and the availability of many fishing options. Catch-related factors were also important and positively related to participation. The results suggest that management agencies could use actions such as stocking to provide more fishing opportunities across the landscape, or increase the accessibility of opportunities in order to retain licence sales. However, the results also imply that participation decisions arise from more than just considerations of catch at and the accessibility of fishing sites, i.e., socio-demographic characteristics. Management implications The results of this study offer a novel analytical approach for deriving management recommendations, based on a model of fishing licence sales as a function of resource quality and socio-demographic information on a regional scale. The analysis, based on these aggregate types of data, relies on information for 188 administrative units covering the entire province of British Columbia, Canada, and provides a number of important insights for fisheries management: Stocking activities are an effective instrument to steer participation in recreational fishing;providing more fishing opportunities, or increasing accessibility is likely to lead to increased participation rates and licence sales; andnon-catch related factors (i.e. accessibility, constraints, socio-demographic and cultural factors) also influence participation rates. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner-recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner-recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) established the Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF) in 2009 to help meet Canada's international commitments towards sustainable fisheries management. The SFF is a suite of policies and tools intended to ensure the precautionary approach (PA) is incorporated into fisheries management. Seven years later (2016) a federal government audit by the Canadian Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) found that although DFO had identified key components necessary for successful fisheries management in the SFF, it had failed to put these components in place for many stocks and did not always apply them even when they were in place. The DFO response to the CESD audit included a commitment to develop work plans with deliverables outlining priorities and timelines for implementing key aspects of the SFF: reference points, harvest control rules, management plans and rebuilding plans for critically depleted stocks. The present study evaluated progress towards meeting this commitment and found that only 38% of the expected products were completed, 14% are in progress, 40% have progress delayed and are not proceeding as anticipated, while the remaining 8% were suspended. This weak performance highlights a larger trend of inadequate and slow implementation of legislative and policy tools in the management of Canada's fisheries and oceans. With declining health status of Canadian stocks and less than half of critical stocks with rebuilding plans, these failures are having a significant impact on the ability of good policy to promote the long-term health of Canada's fisheries and fishing communities.},

abstract = {The past few years have seen an absolute revolution in genomic technologies and their potential applications to ecology and evolutionary biology research. Such advances open up a range of opportunities for research on non-model organisms and individuals drawn from wild populations. This has resulted in exciting new research seeking to identify the genetic polymorphisms important in adaptation and speciation and how they are organised within the genome. Building on this, there is great interest in the extent to which similar evolutionary patterns are found across multiple populations, particularly whether consistent genetic mechanisms are associated with recurrent phenotypes. A powerful context for disentangling these mechanisms is to focus on highly diverse radiations, where phenotypes vary in and across environments. Therefore, the high diversity found within and among species of salmonid fishes such as charr (Salvelinus) make for an ideal `non'-model for genomic research. This paper outlines some of the current approaches available in ecological genomics and highlights some recent advances in salmonid research. It also suggests avenues for the sort of predictions that can be derived from ecological genomics, with the aim of understanding the genetics behind the fantastic diversity of salmonid fishes.},

abstract = {Large, dominant fish species that are the basis of many fisheries may be naturally so successful due partly to "cultivation effects," where adults crop down forage species that are potential competitors/predators of their own juveniles. Such effects imply a converse impact when adult abundance is severely reduced by fishing: increases in forage species may then cause lagged, apparently depensatory decreases in juvenile survival. Depensatory effects can then delay or prevent stock rebuilding. Cultivation effects are apparently common in freshwater communities and may also explain low recruitment success following severe declines of some major marine stocks such as Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Risk of depensatory effects should be a major target of recruitment research, and management policies should aim for considerably higher spawning abundances than has previously been assumed necessary based on recruitment data collected during adult stock declines associated with fishery development.},

Although angling effort for largemouth bass has increased through time with reductions in trophic state, angling effort for black crappies and sunfish species Lepomis spp. has declined. The growth of largemouth bass less than age 5 has also declined since the late 1980s, and the proportion of memorable-sized fish in electrofishing catches decreased with decreases in total phosphorus. Areal coverage of hydrilla varied dramatically throughout this 20-year period, and angler catch rate of largemouth bass as well as angler harvest rate of black crappies were positively correlated with hydrilla coverage. We believe the current level of nutrients and intermediate levels of vegetation (20-40%) should be maintained to balance the needs of both the angling and nonangling communities and to maximize the economic potential of the lake.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of $\sim$100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10% surface area protection from the current 1.8%. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.},

The outside population of Yelloweye Rockfish was last assessed by DFO in 2015 and reference points were established (Yamanaka et al. 2018).

abstract = {ABSTRACT. This paper considers ocean fisheries as complex adaptive systems and addresses the question of how human institutions might be best matched to their structure and function. Ocean ecosystems operate at multiple scales, but the management of fisheries tends to be aimed at a single species considered at a single broad scale. The paper argues that this mismatch of ecological and management scale makes it difficult to address the fine-scale aspects of ocean ecosystems, and leads to fishing rights and strategies that tend to erode the underlying structure of populations and the system itself. A successful transition to ecosystem-based management will require institutions better able to economize on the acquisition of feedback about the impact of human activities. This is likely to be achieved by multiscale institutions whose organization mirrors the spatial organization of the ecosystem and whose communications occur through a polycentric network. Better feedback will allow the exploration of fine-scale science and the employment of fine-scale fishing restraints, better adapted to the behavior of fish and habitat. The scale and scope of individual fishing rights also needs to be congruent with the spatial structure of the ecosystem. Place-based rights can be expected to create a longer private planning horizon as well as stronger incentives for the private and public acquisition of system relevant knowledge.},

Using a high-resolution biophysical model for the Caribbean region, we report that typical larval dispersal distances of ecologically relevant magnitudes are on the scale of only 10 to 100 kilometers for a variety of reef fish species. We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are quickly gaining popularity as a management option for marine conservation, fisheries, and other human uses of the oceans. Despite the popularity of marine reserves as a management tool, few reserves appear to have been created or designed with an understanding of how reserves affect biological factors or how reserves can be designed to meet biological goals more effectively (e.g., attaining sustainable fish populations). This shortcoming occurs in part because the many studies that have examined the impacts of reserves on marine organisms remain isolated examples or anecdotes; the results of these many studies have not yet been synthesized. Here, I review the empirical work and discuss the theoretical literature to assess the impacts of marine reserves on several biological measures (density, biomass, size of organisms, and diversity), paying particular attention to the role reserve size has in determining those impacts. The results of 89 separate studies show that, on average, with the exception of invertebrate biomass and size, values for all four biological measures are significantly higher inside reserves compared to outside (or after reserve establishment vs. before) when evaluated for both the overall communities and by each functional group within these communities (carnivorous fishes, herbivorous fishes, planktivorous fishes/invertebrate eaters, and invertebrates). Surprisingly, results also show that the relative impacts of reserves, such as the proportional differences in density or biomass, are independent of reserve size, suggesting that the effects of marine reserves increase directly rather than proportionally with the size of a reserve. However, equal relative differences in biological measures between small and large reserves nearly always translate into greater absolute differences for larger reserves, and so larger reserves may be necessary to meet the goals set for marine reserves.

The quality of the data in the reviewed studies varied greatly. To improve data quality in the future, whenever possible, studies should take measurements before and after the creation of a reserve, replicate sampling, and include a suite of representative species. Despite the variable quality of the data, the results from this review suggest that nearly any marine habitat can benefit from the implementation of a reserve. Success of a marine reserve, however, will always be judged against the expectations for that reserve, and so we must keep in mind the goals of a reserve in its design, management, and evaluation.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of marine fishes can change for many reasons, including density-dependent distributional shifts. Previous studies show mixed support for either the proportional-density model (PDM; no relationship between abundance and area occupied, supported by ideal-free distribution theory) or the basin model (BM; positive abundance-area relationship, supported by density-dependent habitat selection theory). The BM implies that fishes move towards preferred habitat as the population declines. We estimate the average relationship using bottom trawl data for 92 fish species from six marine regions, to determine whether the BM or PDM provides a better description for sea-bottom-associated fishes. We fit a spatio-temporal model and estimate changes in effective area occupied and abundance, and combine results to estimate the average abundance-area relationship as well as variability among taxa and regions. The average relationship is weak but significant (0.6% increase in area for a 10% increase in abundance), whereas only a small proportion of species-region combinations show a negative relationship (i.e. shrinking area when abundance increases). Approximately one-third of combinations (34.6%) are predicted to increase in area more than 1% for every 10% increase in abundance. We therefore infer that population density generally changes faster than effective area occupied during abundance changes. Gadiformes have the strongest estimated relationship (average 1.0% area increase for every 10% abundance increase) followed by Pleuronectiformes and Scorpaeniformes, and the Eastern Bering Sea shows a strong relationship between abundance and area occupied relative to other regions. We conclude that the BM explains a small but important portion of spatial dynamics for sea-bottom-associated fishes, and that many individual populations merit cautious management during population declines, because a compressed range may increase the efficiency of harvest.},

abstract = {Together with life-history and underlying physiology, the behavioural variability among fish is one of the three main trait axes that determines the vulnerability to fishing. However, there are only a few studies that have systematically investigated the strength and direction of selection acting on behavioural traits. Using in situ fish behaviour revealed by telemetry techniques as input, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) that simulated the Lagrangian trajectory of prey (fish) moving within a confined home range (HR). Fishers exhibiting various prototypical fishing styles targeted these fish in the model. We initially hypothesised that more active and more explorative individuals would be systematically removed under all fished conditions, in turn creating negative selection differentials on low activity phenotypes and maybe on small HR. Our results partly supported these general predictions. Standardised selection differentials were, on average, more negative on HR than on activity. However, in many simulation runs, positive selection pressures on HR were also identified, which resulted from the stochastic properties of the fishes' movement and its interaction with the human predator. In contrast, there was a consistent negative selection on activity under all types of fishing styles. Therefore, in situations where catchability depends on spatial encounters between human predators and fish, we would predict a consistent selection towards low activity phenotypes and have less faith in the direction of the selection on HR size. Our study is the first theoretical investigation on the direction of fishery-induced selection of behaviour using passive fishing gears. The few empirical studies where catchability of fish was measured in relation to passive fishing techniques, such as gill-nets, traps or recreational fishing, support our predictions that fish in highly exploited situations are, on average, characterised by low swimming activity, stemming, in part, from negative selection on swimming activity.},

The <i>per capita</i> recruitment rate was almost two times higher in source-sink than in the source-source system, but this did not compensate for the loss rate due to dispersal from source to sink patches.

abstract = {Objective: Managing data-limited populations is a challenge to the sustainability of fisheries globally. Meta-analytic approaches, where insights from data-rich populations are drawn on to inform data-limited ones, along with the use of habitat-based information, have each been proposed as ways to overcome data-limited assessment challenges, but the two approaches have rarely been combined. Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn and rear in many remote coastal watersheds of British Columbia, Canada, challenging comprehensive population assessments. Estimating conservation and management reference points for such populations is particularly relevant given their importance to Indigenous and commercial fisheries. Most Sockeye Salmon have obligate lake-rearing as juveniles, and total abundance is typically limited by production in nursery lakes. Although methods have been developed to estimate population capacity based on the photosynthetic rate of nursery lakes and lake area or volume, they have not yet been widely incorporated into spawner-recruitment analyses. Methods: We tested the value of combining these lake-based capacity estimates with various hierarchical structures in spawner-recruitment analyses to assess population status using a set of Bayesian spawner-recruitment models for 69 populations across coastal British Columbia, many of which were data limited. Results: Our analysis revealed regional variation in the population productivity of Sockeye Salmon, with coastal populations exhibiting slightly lower mean productivity than those in interior watersheds. Hierarchical spawner-recruitment models with and without informative lake habitat-based priors greatly improved predictive ability across all populations. Conclusions: These findings reveal opportunities to integrate spatial analyses of habitat characteristics with population models to inform the conservation and management of exploited species and their natal habitats, particularly where populations are data limited.},
