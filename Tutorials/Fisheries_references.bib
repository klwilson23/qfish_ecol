abstract = {Abstract Sustainable exploitation of Ontario's aquatic resources calls for a new management approach. This vast resource includes more than 250,000 lakes and offers angling opportunities for many popular species (e.g., walleye Sander vitreus (formerly Stizostedion vitreum), lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, brook trout S. fontinalis, northern pike Esox lucius, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, largemouth bass M. salmoides, and muskellunge E. masquinongy). In pioneer days, the “apparently inexhaustible abundance of resources” fostered an open-access policy promoting the recreational use of these resources for the benefit of the economy. After World War II, there was a rapid increase in angling effort and by the 1970s many lakes were being overexploited. Clearly, an unrestricted, open-access policy was no longer appropriate. The result has been a rapid proliferation of fishing regulations as exceptions to divisionwide regulations that were created to protect lakes where problems were detected. The growin...},

abstract = {Oil and gas interests and the government recently offered a First Nation in the Skeena River estuary (BC, Canada) $1 billion to consent to construction of a controversial terminal to load fossil fuels onto tankers ([ 1 ][1]). The proposal highlights a troubling blind spot in Canada's environmental decisionmaking. This gap could enable decisions that insufficiently consider risks to both environment and people. Science can help decrease these blind spots. The second-largest salmon producer in Canada, the Skeena River has supported First Nation fisheries for 5 millennia ([ 2 ][2]). Its estuary is a nursery for hundreds of millions of young salmon annually as they graduate from freshwater to sea ([ 2 ][2]). It is also situated between fossil fuel reserves in interior Canada and ocean-access to Asian markets. Multinational companies have proposed pipelines to and terminals in the estuary, and are currently assessing the environmental impacts on constitutionally protected ([ 3 ][3]) aboriginal fisheries. Previous research indicates that industrialized estuaries depress salmon survival ([ 4 ][4]). Although terminal proponents and the government have recognized interests of First Nations from the estuary during environmental assessment, they have ignored interests of upriver First Nations who also harvest salmon ([ 5 ][5]). Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers during their life. We have shown that the proposed development area supports particularly high abundances of juvenile salmon from more than 40 populations that are harvested in at least 10 First Nations territories throughout the Skeena watershed and beyond ([ 6 ][6], [ 7 ][7]). This is twice the number of First Nations groups that industry proponents identified as needing to be consulted ([ 5 ][5]). These data reveal a striking mismatch between the narrow consideration of aboriginal rights and environmental risks and the true scale of environmental connections, which needs to be addressed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and industrial proponents. The terminal application is being evaluated by CEAA without consideration of upriver First Nations ([ 5 ][5]). Moreover, despite the resounding rejection of the $1 billion by the estuary First Nation due to environmental and cultural concerns, the government has ratified fiscal agreements with terminal proponents ([ 8 ][8]).

abstract = {To remain viable, populations must be resilient to both natural and human-caused environmental changes. We evaluated anthropogenic effects on spatial connections among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) (designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) in the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. For several anthropogenic-effects scenarios, we used graph theory to characterize the spatial relation among populations. We plotted variance in population size against connectivity among populations. In our scenarios, reduced habitat quality decreased the size of populations and hydropower dams on rivers led to the extirpation of several populations, both of which decreased connectivity. Operation of fish hatcheries increased connectivity among populations and led to patchy or panmictic populations. On the basis of our results, we believe recolonization of the upper Cowlitz River by fall and spring Chinook and winter steelhead would best restore metapopulation structure to near-historical conditions. Extant populations that would best conserve connectivity would be those inhabiting the Molalla (spring Chinook), lower Cowlitz, or Clackamas (fall Chinook) rivers and the south Santiam (winter steelhead) and north fork Lewis rivers (summer steelhead). Populations in these rivers were putative sources; however, they were not always the most abundant or centrally located populations. This result would not have been obvious if we had not considered relations among populations in a metapopulation context. Our results suggest that dispersal rate strongly controls interactions among the populations that comprise salmon metapopulations. Thus, monitoring efforts could lead to understanding of the true rates at which wild and hatchery fish disperse. Our application of graph theory allowed us to visualize how metapopulation structure might respond to human activity. The method could be easily extended to evaluations of anthropogenic effects on other stream-dwelling populations and communities and could help prioritize among competing conservation measures.},

abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Spatial complexity in metacommunities can be separated into 3 main components: size (i.e., number of habitat patches), spatial arrangement of habitat patches (network topology), and diversity of habitat patch types. Much attention has been paid to lattice-type networks, such as patch-based metapopulations, but interest in understanding ecological networks of alternative geometries is building. Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) include some increasingly threatened ecological systems, such as caves and streams. The restrictive architecture of dendritic ecological networks might have overriding implications for species persistence. I used a modeling approach to investigate how number and spatial arrangement of habitat patches influence metapopulation extinction risk in 2 DENs of different size and topology. Metapopulation persistence was higher in larger networks, but this relationship was mediated by network topology and the dispersal pathways used to navigate the network. Larger networks, especially those with greater topological complexity, generally had lower extinction risk than smaller and less-complex networks, but dispersal bias and magnitude affected the shape of this relationship. Applying these general results to real systems will require empirical data on the movement behavior of organisms and will improve our understanding of the implications of network complexity on population and community patterns and processes},

abstract = {The way in which density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal are key in determining the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations. Here we propose a mechanistic approach to understanding how the relative importance of these sources of density dependence can change over ontogeny through changes in dispersal abilities, energy stores and mortality risks. Whereas the potential for active dispersal typically increases over ontogeny as a function of body size, susceptibility to starvation and predation decreases. The joint effect of these mechanisms suggests a general model for the ontogenetic sequence of how density dependence is manifested, with density dependence early in ontogeny being primarily expressed as mortality on local spatial scales, whereas later stages respond to local density in terms of dispersal and potentially growth. Here we test this model by manipulating the densities of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at two life-history stages in the wild. Density-dependent mortality during the early juvenile stage (i.e. fry at onset of exogenous feeding) was accompanied by no effects on body size and weak effects on dispersal. In contrast, dispersal of older juveniles (i.e. parr 2-3 months after onset of feeding) was strongly density-dependent, with more individuals emigrating from high-density release sites, and with no effect of initial density on mortality. This dispersal, however, appeared insufficient to produce an ideal free distribution within the study stream, as indicated by the effect of spatial variation in density on body size by the end of the first growth season. These results demonstrate that the way density-dependent effects are partitioned amongst survival, growth and dispersal changes throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, these changes occur in correlation with changes in individual mortality risks and dispersal abilities, and suggest a general paradigm for the way in which juvenile density-dependence is manifest in spatially structured populations of highly fecund organisms.

abstract = {In marine populations, spatial structure arises over a wide range of scales and forms hierarchical aggregations. Changing spatial structure can alter the demographic and life history trait variation within populations and subject individuals to both novel environmental conditions and interspecific interactions. Thus, changes in the spatial structure of marine populations can be a prelude to further changes in abundance and can affect the resilience and recovery potential of populations following anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. These observations under - score the importance of studying the spatial ecology of marine fish populations in order to (1) understand the underlying mechanisms that can lead to rapid alterations in population abundance and community interactions, (2) provide indicators of stock health, and (3) characterize the consequences of changing spatial patterns on population susceptibility to exploitation and environmental variability. Here, we synthesize the interacting factors that influence the formation, maintenance and erosion of spatial structure in marine fish populations and identify the further con sequences of such erosion at the population and community levels. We emphasize human driven changes of population spatial structure for 3 levels of population genetic aggregation that are common in fisheries management scenarios, namely sympatric populations, metapopulations and panmictic populations. Case studies are presented for each level of aggregation. Throughout our review, we both summarize the factors that link spatial and temporal dynamics in marine populations and highlight the management and conservation implications of such linkages. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract = {Spatial, phenotypic and genetic diversity at relatively small scales can buffer species against large-scale processes such as climate change that tend to synchronize populations and increase temporal variability in overall abundance or production. This portfolio effect generally results in improved biological and economic outcomes for managed species. Previous evidence for the portfolio effect in salmonids has arisen from examinations of time series of adult abundance, but we lack evidence of spatial buffering of temporal variability in demographic rates such as survival of juveniles during their first year of life. We therefore use density-dependent population models with multiple random effects to represent synchronous (similar among populations) and asynchronous (different among populations) temporal variability as well as spatial variability in survival. These are fitted to 25 years of survey data for breeding adults and surviving juveniles from 15 demographically distinct populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within a single metapopulation in the Snake River in Idaho, USA. Model selection identifies the most support for the model that included both synchronous and asynchronous temporal variability, in addition to spatial variability. Asynchronous variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}55) is approximately equal in magnitude to synchronous temporal variability (log-SD = 0{\textperiodcentered}67), but much lower than spatial variability (log-SD = 1{\textperiodcentered}11). We also show that the pairwise correlation coefficient, a common measure of population synchrony, is approximated by the estimated ratio of shared and total variance, where both approaches yield a synchrony estimate of 0{\textperiodcentered}59. We therefore find evidence for spatial buffering of temporal variability in early juvenile survival, although between-population variability that persists over time is also large. We conclude that spatial variation decreases interannual changes in overall juvenile production, which suggests that conservation and restoration of spatial diversity will improve population persistence for this metapopulation. However, the exact magnitude of spatial buffering depends upon demographic parameters such as adult survival that may vary among populations and is proposed as an area of future research using hierarchical life cycle models. We recommend that future sampling of this metapopulation employ a repeated-measure sampling design to improve estimation of early juvenile carrying capacity. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {1. It has been suggested that the habitats which a species occupies can be divided into sources and sinks, depending on whether or not local reproduction is sufficient to balance mortality. Source populations are those where reproduction exceeds mortality, surplus individuals dispersing to sink populations where mortality exceeds local reproduction. Sink populations would not be viable in the absence of immigration. 2. A difference equation model is constructed to show that sources and sinks cannot be identified from a simple comparison of the demographic rates between populations, as measured by the numbers of births and deaths. 3. Viable populations may appear to be non-viable simply because the dispersal of individuals into them depresses fecundity or increases mortality as a result of density-dependence. The consequence is that local recruitment appears insufficient to balance local mortality. 4. Viable populations that appear as sinks, as a result of the dispersal of individuals into them, are termed here as `pseudo-sinks'. They will clearly be difficult to distinguish from genuine sinks on the basis of a simple comparison of the numbers of births and deaths in different populations. 5. Examples of source and genuine sink populations and the data required to establish them are discussed.},

abstract = {1 The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2 Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3 Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4 At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5 Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density.

abstract = {Oil and gas interests and the government recently offered a First Nation in the Skeena River estuary (BC, Canada) $1 billion to consent to construction of a controversial terminal to load fossil fuels onto tankers ([ 1 ][1]). The proposal highlights a troubling blind spot in Canada's environmental decisionmaking. This gap could enable decisions that insufficiently consider risks to both environment and people. Science can help decrease these blind spots. The second-largest salmon producer in Canada, the Skeena River has supported First Nation fisheries for 5 millennia ([ 2 ][2]). Its estuary is a nursery for hundreds of millions of young salmon annually as they graduate from freshwater to sea ([ 2 ][2]). It is also situated between fossil fuel reserves in interior Canada and ocean-access to Asian markets. Multinational companies have proposed pipelines to and terminals in the estuary, and are currently assessing the environmental impacts on constitutionally protected ([ 3 ][3]) aboriginal fisheries. Previous research indicates that industrialized estuaries depress salmon survival ([ 4 ][4]). Although terminal proponents and the government have recognized interests of First Nations from the estuary during environmental assessment, they have ignored interests of upriver First Nations who also harvest salmon ([ 5 ][5]). Salmon migrate thousands of kilometers during their life. We have shown that the proposed development area supports particularly high abundances of juvenile salmon from more than 40 populations that are harvested in at least 10 First Nations territories throughout the Skeena watershed and beyond ([ 6 ][6], [ 7 ][7]). This is twice the number of First Nations groups that industry proponents identified as needing to be consulted ([ 5 ][5]). These data reveal a striking mismatch between the narrow consideration of aboriginal rights and environmental risks and the true scale of environmental connections, which needs to be addressed by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) and industrial proponents. The terminal application is being evaluated by CEAA without consideration of upriver First Nations ([ 5 ][5]). Moreover, despite the resounding rejection of the $1 billion by the estuary First Nation due to environmental and cultural concerns, the government has ratified fiscal agreements with terminal proponents ([ 8 ][8]). The Skeena Watershed is united by salmon; First Nations throughout the watershed should be involved in decisio{\ldots}},

abstract = {Worldwide depletion of fish stocks has led fisheries managers to become increasingly concerned about rebuilding and recovery planning. To succeed, factors affecting recovery dynamics need to be understood, including the role of fisheries-induced evolution. Here we investigate a stock's response to fishing followed by a harvest moratorium by analyzing an individual-based evolutionary model parameterized for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua from its northern range, representative of long-lived, late-maturing species. The model allows evolution of life-history processes including maturation, reproduction, and growth. It also incorporates environmental variability, phenotypic plasticity, and density-dependent feedbacks. Fisheries-induced evolution affects recovery in several ways. The first decades of recovery were dominated by demographic and density-dependent processes. Biomass rebuilding was only lightly influenced by fisheries-induced evolution, whereas other stock characteristics such as maturation age, spawning stock biomass, and recruitment were substantially affected, recovering to new demographic equilibria below their preharvest levels. This is because genetic traits took thousands of years to evolve back to preharvest levels, indicating that natural selection driving recovery of these traits is weaker than fisheries-induced selection was. Our results strengthen the case for proactive management of fisheries-induced evolution, as the restoration of genetic traits altered by fishing is slow and may even be impractical. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Use of extensive but low-resolution abundance data is common in the assessment of species at-risk status based on quantitative decline criteria under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and national endangered species legislation. Such data can be problematic for 3 reasons. First, statistical power to reject the null hypothesis of no change is often low because of small sample size and high sampling uncertainty leading to a high frequency of type II errors. Second, range-wide assessments composed of multiple site-specific observations do not effectively weight site-specific trends into global trends. Third, uncertainty in site-specific temporal trends and relative abundance are not propagated at the appropriate spatial scale. A common result is the propensity to underestimate the magnitude of declines and therefore fail to identify the appropriate at-risk status for a species. We used 3 statistical approaches, from simple to more complex, to estimate temporal decline rates for a designatable unit (DU) of rainbow trout in the Athabasca River watershed in western Canada. This DU is considered a native species for purposes of listing because of its genetic composition characterized as >0.95 indigenous origin in the face of continuing introgressive hybridization with introduced populations in the watershed. Analysis of abundance trends from 57 time series with a fixed-effects model identified 33 sites with negative trends, but only 2 were statistically significant. By contrast, a hierarchical linear mixed model weighted by site-specific abundance provided a DU-wide decline estimate of 16.4% per year and a 3-generation decline of 93.2%. A hierarchical Bayesian mixed model yielded a similar 3-generation decline trend of 91.3% and the posterior distribution showed that the estimate had a >99% probability of exceeding thresholds for an endangered listing. We conclude that the Bayesian approach was the most useful because it provided a probabilistic statement of threshold exceedance in support of an at-risk status recommendation.},

abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis can be a useful method for improving estimation of key parameters for harvested fish populations. In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

abstract = {Data collected on juvenile anadromous salmonids implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are used in mark-recapture analyses to understand the factors affecting survival of fish estimated between rearing in riverine habitat and dam passage.We estimated parr-to-smolt survival of PIT-tagged naturally produced subyearling fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha to examine the previously unexplored influences of environmental and biological conditions measured prior to reservoir entry. Mean (±SE) parr-to-smolt survival of the early migrating cohorts was 45.4 ± 6.3% (n = 13) compared with 37.4 ± 4.7% (n = 13) for later migrating cohorts. Annual mean parr-to-smolt survival differed widely across years ranging from a low of 9.6 ± 0.5% (n = 2) in 2001 to a high of 81.7 ± 4.6% (n = 2) in 1999. Parr growth prior to reservoir entry and reservoir velocity provided the most information on variability in parr-to-smolt survival (N = 26, R2 = 0.75, corrected Akaike's information criterion [AICc]=-5.01). We suggest that parr growth and reservoir velocity were directly proportional to parr-to-smolt survival because fast growth and downstream movement reduces the time when fish are vulnerable to predators. The effect of reservoir velocity comports with previous published studies and supports management efforts to increase reservoir velocity. Few if any published studies explicitly relate parr growth measured on individual fish to survival estimated for their cohorts in freshwater. This study provides empirical evidence that upholds the long-held belief that any anthropogenic activity that reduces growth of juvenile salmonids during freshwater rearing has the potential to reduce their survival.},

abstract = {In the model described, we attempt to link breeding-site selection to population dynamics for situations in which there is more than one distinct type of habitat. The distribution of individuals between habitat types depends on the selective abilities of the species. This distribution, in turn, influences the population dynamics of the species as a whole. We show that the consequences of habitat selection on population dynamics for an ideal free distribution of individuals across habitats is predictably different from what would be predicted if habitat selection were preemptive, that is, if individuals, upon selecting a site, prevented others from sharing the site. If preemptive selection is ideal, average reproductive success declines with increasing density because each individual selects the best site available from those sites not yet occupied. The model allows us to compare the relative contribution of different types of habitats to a species' growth rate and population size. Furthermore, we can also predict how the loss of habitat of a particular type may affect a population. This should make the model useful for environmental management problems as well as for describing the present distribution of a species across a spatially heterogeneous landscape.},

This leads to false impressions of the past, inaccurate baselines, and unrealistic recovery goals. Idaho biologists have counted Chinook salmon redds for >60 consecutive years, generating an invaluable database; however, inaccurate historical baselines compromise the utility of even such high-quality, long-term databases. To develop an accurate baseline, we integrated archival (1951–1964), maximum redd counts with contemporary (1995–2017), continuous counts and spawn timing datasets to estimate historical (1950s–1960s) wild Chinook salmon production potential. Current salmon populations average 3% of 1950s–1960s abundances, which may have been 30% of precommercial fishery (1880s) populations. Notably, the SBS has influenced contemporary managers as reflected in minimum viable abundance, sustainable escapement, and adequate seeding objectives equaling 10.4%, 17.9%, and 20.4%, respectively, of 1950s–1960s potential. Our approach provides a framework for utilizing archival and contemporary data to reconstruct historical baselines and repress SBS. Contrasting contemporary goals with maximum production potential provides new reference points and perspectives for managers to consider.},

Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales.

abstract = {The study and implementation of no-take marine reserves have increased rapidly over the past decade, providing ample data on the biological effects of reserve protection for a wide range of geographic locations and organisms. The plethora of new studies affords the opportunity to reevaluate previous findings and address formerly unanswered questions with extensive data syntheses. Our results show, on average, positive effects of reserve protection on the biomass, numerical density, species richness, and size of organisms within their boundaries which are remarkably similar to those of past syntheses despite a near doubling of data. New analyses indicate that (1) these results do not appear to be an artifact of reserves being sited in better locations; (2) results do not appear to be driven by displaced fishing effort outside of reserves; (3) contrary to often-made assertions, reserves have similar if not greater positive effects in temperate settings, at least for reef ecosystems; (4) even small reserves can produce significant biological responses irrespective of latitude, although more data are needed to test whether reserve effects scale with reserve size; and (5) effects of reserves vary for different taxonomic groups and for taxa with various characteristics, and not all species increase in response to reserve protection. There is considerable variation in the responses documented across all the reserves in our data set-variability which cannot be entirely explained by which species were studied. We suggest that reserve characteristics and context, particularly the intensity of fishing outside the reserve and inside the reserve before implementation, play key roles in determining the direction and magnitude of the reserve response. However, despite considerable variability, positive responses are far more common than no differences or negative responses, validating the potential for well designed and enforced reserves to serve as globally important conservation and management tools.},

abstract = {Biodiversity targets, or estimates of the quantities of biodiversity features that should be conserved in a region, are fundamental to systematic conservation planning. We propose that targets for species should be based on the quantitative thresholds developed for the Vulnerable category of the IUCN Red List system, thereby avoiding future listings of species in an IUCN Red List threat category or an increase in the extinction risk, or ultimate extinction, of species already listed as threatened. Examples of this approach are presented for case studies from South Africa, including threatened taxa listed under the IUCN Red List criteria of A to D, a species listed as Near Threatened, a species of conservation concern due to its rarity, and one species in need of recovery. The method gives rise to multiple representation targets, an improvement on the often used single representation targets that are inadequate for long term maintenance of biodiversity or the arbitrary multiple representation and percentage targets that are sometimes adopted. Through the implementation of the resulting conservation plan, these targets will ensure that the conservation status of threatened species do not worsen over time by qualifying for higher categories of threat and may actually improve their conservation status by eliminating the threat of habitat loss and stabilizing population declines.

abstract = {Natural disturbances and habitat degradation are major factors influencing the dynamics and persistence of many wildlife populations, yet few large-scale studies have explored the relative influence of these factors on the dynamics and persistence of animal populations. We used longterm demographic data and matrix population models to examine the potential effects of habitat degradation and natural disturbances on the dynamics of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. We found that estimates of stochastic population growth rate were low (0.90). Population growth rate ($\lambda$) during the first half or our study period (1992 to 1998) was substantially greater than during the second half (1999 to 2005). These 2 periods were characterized by contrasting hydrological conditions. Although $\lambda$ was most sensitive to changes in adult survival, the analysis of life table response experiments revealed that a reduction in fertility of kites accounted for >80% of the observed decline in population growth rate. We examined the possibility that the reduction in $\lambda$ was caused by (1) habitat degradation due to management, (2) an increase in frequency of moderate drying events in recent years, and (3) both habitat degradation and an increase in frequency of moderate drying events. Our results suggest that both factors could potentially contribute to a large decrease in population growth rate. Our study highlights the importance of simultaneously considering short- and long-term effects of disturbances when modeling population dynamics. Indeed, focusing exclusively on one type of effect may be misleading to both our understanding of the ecological dynamics of the system and to management. The relevance of our results to management is heightened because the snail kite has been selected as a key performance measure of one of the most ambitious ecosystem restoration projects ever undertaken. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract = {Establishment of marine protected areas, including fully protected marine reserves, is one of the few management tools available for local communities to combat the deleterious effect of large scale environmental impacts, including global climate change, on ocean ecosystems. Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection.},

abstract = {The wider effects of fishing on marine ecosystems have become the focus of growing concern among scientists, fisheries managers and the fishing industry. The present review examines the role of habitat structure and habitat heterogeneity in marine ecosystems, and the effects of fishing (i.e. trawling and dredging) on these two components of habitat complexity. Three examples from New Zealand and Australia are considered, where available evidence suggests that fishing has been associated with the degradation or loss of habitat structure through the removal of large epibenthic organisms, with concomitant effects on fish species which occupy these habitats. With ever-increasing demands on fish-stocks and the need for sustainable use of fisheries resources, new approaches to fisheries management are needed. Fisheries management needs to address the sustainability of fish-stocks while minimizing the direct and indirect impacts of fishing on other components of the ecosystem. Two long-term management tools for mitigating degradation or loss of habitat structure while maintaining healthy sustainable fisheries which are increasingly considered by fisheries scientists and managers are: (1) protective habitat management, which involves the designation of protected marine and coastal areas which are afforded some level of protection from fishing; and (2) habitat restoration, whereby important habitat and ecological functions are restored following the loss of habitat and/or resources. Nevertheless, the protection of marine and coastal areas, and habitat restoration should not be seen as solutions replacing conventional management approaches, but need to be components of an integrated programme of coastal zone and fisheries management. A number of recent international fisheries agreements have specifically identified the need to provide for habitat protection and restoration to ensure long-term sustainability of fisheries. The protection and restoration of habitat are also common components of fisheries management programs under national fisheries law and policy.},

abstract = {Although pairwise interactions have always had a key role in ecology and evolutionary biology, the recent increase in the amount and availability of biological data has placed a new focus on the complex networks embedded in biological systems. The increased availability of computational tools to store and retrieve biological data has facilitated wide access to these data, not just by biologists but also by specialists from the social sciences, computer science, physics and mathematics. This fusion of interests has led to a burst of research on the properties and consequences of network structure in biological systems. Although traditional measures of network structure and function have started us off on the right foot, an important next step is to create biologically realistic models of network formation, evolution, and function. Here, we review recent applications of network thinking to the evolution of networks at the gene and protein level and to the dynamics and stability of communities. These studies have provided new insights into the organization and function of biological systems by applying existing techniques of network analysis. The current challenge is to recognize the commonalities in evolutionary and ecological applications of network thinking to create a predictive science of biological networks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the number of populations and a 10-fold increase in the habitat area occupied. The improving status of H. comma is the product of good habitat management, recovering rabbit populations and climate warming, which have improved the quality, and increased the availability, of suitable habitat. This has enabled remnant metapopulations to expand, via distance-dependent colonisation, through large networks of habitat. Metapopulation recovery in H. comma demonstrates that landscape-scale conservation can be successful. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Fifteen of 19 populations showed evidence of a significant decrease in growth rate with increasing density. In 11 of these 15 populations, the pattern of density-dependent growth was better described by a negative power curve than by a linear regression (i.e. Akaike Information Criterion, AIClinear - AICpower > 2), whereas only one population was better described by a linear regression than by a negative power curve; three populations were adequately described by both models (AIC < 2). In 10 of the 11 populations that were best described by a negative power curve, most of the decrease in growth rate occurred at population densities <1 fish m-2, when space limitation is unlikely. This analysis provides broad support for the hypothesis that density-dependent growth in stream salmonids occurs primarily at low population densities, probably due to exploitative competition. {\textcopyright} The Fisheries Society of the British Isles, 2005.},

Here, we analyze a time series of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance and examine the hypothesis that spatial contraction can decrease compen- satory capacity. Over the last 20 years, steelhead in the Keogh River have declined by an order of magnitude because of a period of poor smolt-to-adult survival. Low abundance has been associated with more depressed production of out-migrating smolts than would be expected based on traditional models of compensatory dynamics. Patterns of juvenile density over time show changes in the spatial distribution of the population. We developed a spatially explicit population model to explore spatial structure and juvenile recruitment under varying marine survival. Results suggest that spatial contraction during a period of poor marine survival can strengthen density-dependent population regulation, reducing smolt production at the watershed scale. Our results highlight that spatial contraction can alter the fundamental density-dependent relationships that define population dynamics, recovery trajectories, and sustainable harvest levels of spatially structured populations},

abstract = {Scale transition theory is an approach to understanding population and community dynamics in the presence of spatial or temporal variation in environmental factors or population densities. It focuses on changes in the equations for population dynamics as the scale enlarges. These changes are explained in terms of interactions between nonlinearities and variation on lower scales, and they predict the emergence of new properties on larger scales that are not predicted by lower scale dynamics in the absence of variation on those lower scales. These phenomena can be understood in terms of statistical inequalities arising from the process of nonlinear averaging, which translates the rules for dynamics from lower to higher scales. Nonlinearities in population dynamics are expressions of the fundamental biology of the interactions between individual organisms. Variation that interacts with these nonlinearities also involves biology fundamentally in several different ways. First, there are the aspects of biology that are sensitive to variation in space or time. These determine which aspects of a nonlinear dynamical equation are affected by variation, and whether different individuals or different species are sensitive to different extents or to different aspects of variation. Second is the nature of the variation, for example, whether it is variation in the physical environment or variation in population densities. From the interplay between variation and nonlinearities in population dynamics, scale transition theory builds a theory of changes in dynamics with changes in scale. In this article, the focus is on spatial variation, and the theory is illustrated with examples relevant to the dynamics of insect communities. In these communities, one commonly occurring nonlinear relationship is a negative exponential relationship between survival of an organism and the densities of natural enemies or competitors. This negative exponential has a biological origin in terms of independent actions of many individuals. The subsequent effects of spatial variation can be represented naturally in terms of Laplace transforms and related statistical transforms to obtain both analytical solutions and an extra level of understanding. This process allows us to analyze the meaning and effects of aggregation of insects in space. Scale transition theory more generally, however, does not aim to have fully analytical solutions but partial analytical solutions applicable for circumstances too complex for full analytical solution. These partial solutions are intended to provide a framework for understanding of numerical solutions, simulations and field studies where key quantities can be estimated from empirical data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Most fisheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that fish are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that fish movement is such that local fishing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in fishing mortality, growth and recruitment are identified. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and fishery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on fishery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment configurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and final spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and final spawning biomass. Assessment configurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment configuration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and fishery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model configurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model specification.},

abstract = {We examined the factors that influenced movement probabilities of snail kites (Rostrhamus sociabilis) in Florida, USA, based on birds with radio transmitters (n = 282) during a three-year period from April 1992 through April 1995. We focused on the hypotheses that increased movement probabilities were in response to low food availability or low water levels; the latter also implying low food availability for this species. An alternative hypothesis was that snail kites exhibit exploratory behavior, and corresponding increased movement probabilities, during periods of high food availability. Movement probabilities were not consistent with the hypotheses that low water levels or low food availability were the proximate cues to initiate movement from one wetland to another. Movement probabilities were higher during periods of relatively high food availability and were not associated with water levels; thus were consistent with the hypothesis that snail kites exhibited exploratory behavior during times of food abundance. However, we do not believe that our results are in conflict with previous reports of increased movement during extreme food scarcity; rather, that these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and reflect different resource levels. During extreme drying events, food becomes virtually unavailable and birds must either move or die, but during times of food abundance there may be an advantage of exploratory behavior. Given that local drying events occur at frequencies of approximately every 5-10 yr in this environment, having explored wetlands throughout their range reduces the need for "blind" searching for suitable alternative habitats when such events do occur.},

abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

abstract = {Using numerical models, effects of environmental variability upon yield were tested for six single-age fish stocks characterized by different kinds and degrees of density-dependent reproduction potential. The two levels of variability examined had extremes of yield standing in the ratios 7:1 and 18:1, respectively. Close regulation of fishing to the optimum percentage for each year's stock improves the long-term average catch taken, the improvement being the greater, the more variable the environment. With the higher level of variability, improvement in average catch among five of the stocks ranged from 26% to 79% increase. However this increase in mean catch is achieved at the expense of increased variability in catch from year to year—in fact, for some kinds of stocks there must be complete cessation of fishing in some years in order to get the long-term maximum. The yield of stocks, in which reproduction per spawner declines at low levels of abundance, is particularly improved by a close adaptation of fishing effort to the supply of fish available.When two or more populations of a species, characterized by different reproduction potentials, are fished in common, total potential catch is less than when each can be fished separately at its optimum level. If a common fishery cannot be avoided, the achievement of maximum average yield may find one of two originally-equal stocks as abundant or even more abundant than before the fishery began, while the other may persist only at a low level or even be exterminated completely.},

abstract = {For nearly a century, biologists have emphasized the profound importance of spatial scale for ecology, evolution and conservation. Nonetheless, objectively identifying critical scales has proven incredibly challenging. Here we extend new techniques from physics and social sciences that estimate modularity on networks to identify critical scales for movement and gene flow in animals. Using four species that vary widely in dispersal ability and include both mark-recapture and population genetic data, we identify significant modularity in three species, two of which cannot be explained by geographic distance alone. Importantly, the inclusion of modularity in connectivity and population viability assessments alters conclusions regarding patch importance to connectivity and suggests higher metapopulation viability than when ignoring this hidden spatial scale. We argue that network modularity reveals critical meso-scales that are probably common in populations, providing a powerful means of identifying fundamental scales for biology and for conservation strategies aimed at recovering imperilled species.},

abstract = {Metapopulation dynamics have received much attention in conservation and population biology, but the standard approach has also been criticized for being too restrictive, as it is based on the effects of habitat patch area and isolation only. Here we demonstrate how the effects of habitat quality (extra environmental factors) and detailed landscape structure (described with GIS [Geographical Information System]) can be included in a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. Expanded models are tested with a large data set on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). The incidence function model supplemented with additional environmental factors revealed some new and confirmed some previously known interactions between M. cinxia and its environment. However, the ability of the additional environmental factors to explain the error in the fit of the basic model was generally low (less than or equal to 15%). In the second variant of the basic model, landscape structure was used to modify effective patch isolations. This approach, though biologically appealing, failed to improve significantly the fit of the incidence function model. There are several possible reasons for this failure, including inaccurate satellite data, problems with habitat classification, and most importantly, generic problems in the modeling of migration. Our results demonstrate that additional complexity beyond the effects of habitat patch area and isolation does not necessarily improve the predictive power of a metapopulation model.},

abstract = {Conservation biologists often ignore density dependence because at-risk populations are typically small relative to historical levels. However, if populations are reduced as a result of impacts that lower carrying capacity, then density-dependent mortality may exist at low population abundances. Here, we explore this issue in threatened populations of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We followed the fate of more than 50 000 juvenile chinook in the Snake River Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that their survival was inversely associated with juvenile density. We also tested the hypotheses that non-indigenous brook trout and habitat quality affect the presence or strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that juvenile chinook suffer density-dependent mortality and the strength of density dependence was greater in streams in which brook trout were absent. We were unable to detect an effect of habitat quality on the strength of density dependence. Historical impacts of humans have greatly reduced population sizes of salmon, and the density dependence we report may stem from a shortage of nutrients normally derived from decomposing salmon carcasses. Cohorts of juvenile salmon may experience density-dependent mortality at population sizes far below historical levels and recovery of imperiled populations may be much slower than currently expected.},

abstract = {Biodiversity in agricultural landscapes can be increased with conversion of some production lands into ?more- natural? – unmanaged or extensively managed – lands. However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ?functional landscape heterogeneity?. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Keywords},

abstract = {Many juvenile salmon and trout migrated from the Lemhi River drainage each fall-winter-spring period. Seaward migration of anadromous trout and salmon normally occurred in the spring but pre-smolt anadromous and non-anadromous fishes also left the stream usually beginning in the fall. I compared data on temperature, food abundance, stream flow, cover and population density with movements and conducted field and laboratory tests to determine reasons for the two types of movements. Smolts of the anadromous species migrated for an obvious reason but none of the factors I examined appeared to “stimulate or release” their seaward migration. Movement frequently coincided with changes in water temperature and stream flow, but I could not establish a consistent causal relationship and concluded that photoperiod and perhaps growth must initiate the physiological and behavioral changes associated with seaward migration. Non-anadromous and pre-smolt anadromous species emigrated from the streams for different reasons than the smolts. I postulated that fish found the stream environment unsuitable during the winter. Stream temperature declined in the fall as fish began moving from the streams but I could not induce more fish to stay in test troughs with 12 C water versus troughs with 0–10 C water. Fish emigrated before abundance of drift insects declined in winter. Emigration occurred in spite of the relatively stable flows in both streams. Population density modified the basic migration pattern by regulating the number and percentage of fish that emigrated and to a limited extent time of emigration. Movements of non-smolt trout and salmon correlated best with the amount of cover provided by large rubble substrate. Subyearling trout emigrated from Big Springs Creek which contained no rubble substrate but remained in the Lemhi River which did. In both field and laboratory tests more fish remained in troughs or stream sections with large rubble substrate than in troughs or sections with gravel substrate. Trout and salmon in many Idaho streams enter the substrate when stream temperatures declined to 4–6 C. A suitable substrate providing adequate interstices appears necessary or the fish leave.},

abstract = {There is a need to explicitly consider metapopulation dynamics in the development of conservation strategies for spatially-structured populations. We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically-based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identified a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied >90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently other streams make only small contributions to population abundance, however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.},

abstract = {We explore a "Go With the Older Fish" (GWOF) mechanism of learned migration behaviour for exploited fish populations, where recruits learn a viable migration path by randomly joining a school of older fish. We develop a non-age-structured biomass model of spatially independent spawning sites with local density dependence, based on Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). We compare a diffusion (DIFF) strategy, where recruits adopt spawning sites near their natal site without regard to older fish, with GWOF, where recruits adopt the same spawning sites, but in proportion to the abundance of adults using those sites. In both models, older individuals return to their previous spawning site. The GWOF model leads to higher spatial variance in biomass. As total mortality increases, the DIFF strategy results in an approximately proportional decrease in biomass among spawning sites, whereas the GWOF strategy results in abandonment of less productive sites and maintenance of high biomass at more productive sites. A DIFF strategy leads to dynamics comparable to non-spatially structured populations. While the aggregate response of the GWOF strategy is distorted, non-stationary and slow to equilibrate, with a production curve that is distinctly flattened and relatively unproductive. These results indicate that fishing will disproportionately affect populations with GWOF behaviour.},

abstract = {The recovery of large carnivore species from over-exploitation can have socioecological effects; thus, reliable estimates of potential abundance and distribution represent a valuable tool for developing management objectives and recovery criteria. For sea otters (Enhydra lutris), as with many apex predators, equilibrium abundance is not constant across space but rather varies as a function of local habitat quality and resource dynamics, thereby complicating the extrapolation of carrying capacity (K) from one location to another. To overcome this challenge, we developed a state-space model of density-dependent population dynamics in southern sea otters (E. l. nereis), in which K is estimated as a continuously varying function of a suite of physical, biotic, and oceanographic variables, all described at fine spatial scales. We used a theta-logistic process model that included environmental stochasticity and allowed for density-independent mortality associated with shark bites. We used Bayesian methods to fit the model to time series of survey data, augmented by auxiliary data on cause of death in stranded otters. Our model results showed that the expected density at K for a given area can be predicted based on local bathymetry (depth and distance from shore), benthic substrate composition (rocky vs. soft sediments), presence of kelp canopy, net primary productivity, and whether or not the area is inside an estuary. In addition to density-dependent reductions in growth, increased levels of shark-bite mortality over the last decade have also acted to limit population expansion. We used the functional relationships between habitat variables and equilibrium density to project estimated values of K for the entire historical range of southern sea otters in California, USA, accounting for spatial variation in habitat quality. Our results suggest that California could eventually support 17,226 otters (95% CrI = 9,739–30,087). We also used the fitted model to compute candidate values of optimal sustainable population abundance (OSP) for all of California and for regions within California. We employed a simulation-based approach to determine the abundance associated with the maximum net productivity level (MNPL) and propose that the upper quartile of the distribution of MNPL estimates (accounting for parameter uncertainty) represents an appropriate threshold value for OSP. Based on this analysis, we suggest a candidate value for OSP (for all of California) of 10,236, which represents 59.4% of projected K. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {By significantly changing size-dependent mortality, fisheries can cause rapid evolution toward earlier maturation in harvested species. Because earlier maturation negatively affects biomass yield and sustainability, ignoring evolutionary changes could significantly reduce the success of fisheries management policy. With a quantitative genetic model of size at maturation that incorporates phenotype plasticity, we examine the impact of different management strategies including traditional effort control and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). After verifying the model's accuracy, using historical trajectories for size at maturation in cod (Gadus morhua), we test model predictions under different management schemes with life history parameters for red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and two rockfish species (Sebastes paucispinis and S. ruberrimus). The model results show that notake MPAs can protect against strong fisheries-based selection for earlier maturation. The potential to protect against anthropogenic selection declines with increasing fragmentation of reserves to networks of small reserves. Accounting for the evolution of size at maturation increases the predicted biomass contribution from MPA populations to harvested populations. Traditional management approaches, such as adjustments to harvest rate and maximum size limits, can lead to equivalent protection against anthropogenic selection and equivalent or greater long-term biomass yield than establishing MPAs; however, the protection and yield from establishing no-take MPAs appears more robust to uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

abstract = {Native ungulate species constitute an important source of protein for Mesoamerican subsistence hunters. In this study, we (1) provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that source-sink systems help maintain some of the ungulate populations in the Lacandon Forest, Mexico; and (2) test the assumptions that density, age structure, and sex ratios are different in slightly hunted (potential sources) and persistently hunted (potential sinks) populations. From May 1998 to March 2001 we observed 1144 individuals and 1153 tracks of five ungulate species (Baird's tapir, collared peccary, white-lipped peccary, red brocket deer, and white-tailed deer) along 1908 km of line transects in slightly and persistently hunted sites of Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (MABR) and adjacent community lands. Densities of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary were lower in persistently hunted sites, where there were higher proportions of young tapirs and white-tailed deer. The sustainability of hunting was evaluated in five communities using information on harvest rates, production rates, and density of each population. Our results suggest that persistently hunted populations of Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary are at risk of local extinction, while collared peccary hunting appears to be sustainable. The red brocket deer, although locally overhunted, maintains a relatively safe status probably through a source-sink system in which MABR functions as the source of individuals which are readily hunted in adjacent community lands. Source-sink systems may be also important in maintaining Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary populations outside protected areas of the Lacandon Forest, from evidence of migration observed during this study. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We have compiled such a data set by georeferencing the network-scale distribution of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) redds across a large wilderness basin (7330 km2) in central Idaho for 9 years (1995–2003). During this time, the population grew at a rate of 5.3 recruits per spawner, and redd numbers increased from 20 to 2271. As abundances increased, fish expanded into portions of the stream network that had recently been unoccupied. Even at the highest escapements, however, distributions remained clustered, and a limited portion of the network contained the majority of redds. The importance of the highest density spawning areas was greatest when abundances were low, suggesting these areas may serve as refugia during demo- graphic bottlenecks. Analysis of variance indicated that redd numbers were strongly affected by local habitats and broad climatic controls, but also revealed a space–time interaction that suggested temporal instability in spatial patterns. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining habitats with high densities of individuals, but also suggest that broader views may be needed to accommodate the dynamics of natural salmonid populations.

abstract = {The SLOSS (single large or several small) debate is no longer an issue in the discussion about the optimal size of nature reserves. The best way to estimate the minimum sizes of reserves may be a three-step process: (1) identify target or keystone species whose disappearance would significantly decrease the value or species diversity of the reserve; (2) determine the minimum number of individuals in a population needed to guarantee a high probability of survival for these species; (3) using known densities, estimate the area needed to sustain the minimum number. The forces that affect population viability and determine MVPs (minimum viable populations) are extremely complex. Thoughtful estimates of MVPs for many animal species are rarely lower than an effective size of a few hundred. Attempts to save only common or smaller species in a community will usually be ill-fated because of the web of ecological relationships between species, including the importance of predation and herbivory in the maintenance of species diversity. Other topics discussed include the complementarity of conservation goals, the problematic function of corridors and the value of buffer zones. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Demographic approaches can be used to improve our understanding of the dynamics of spatially structured populations and help identify subpopulations critical for the long-term persistence of regional metapopulations. We provide a regional metapopulation analysis to inform conservation management for Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) in five subpopulations defined by land management designations. We used data from an individual-based mark–recapture study to estimate subpopulation sizes, subpopulation growth rates, and movement probabilities among subpopulations. We assessed the source–sink structure of the study population by calculating source–sink statistics, and we created a female-based matrix metapopulation model composed of all subpopulations to examine how variation in demographic components of survival, reproduction, and movement affected metapopulation growth rate. Movement data indicated no subpopulation was completely isolated, but movement probabilities varied among subpopulations. Source–sink statistics and net flow of individuals indicated three subpopulations were sources, while two subpopulations were sinks. We found areas with higher wildlife protection efforts and fewer anthropogenic impacts were sources, and less-protected areas were identified as sinks. Our results highlight the importance of identifying source–sink dynamics among subpopulations for effective conservation planning and emphasize how protected areas can play an important role in sustaining metapopulations.},

The analytical framework was a stochastic, age-structured, stock-overlap model that was seasonally and spatially explicit with movement of eastern- and western-origin tuna informed by tagging and otolith chemistry data. Alternate estimates of movement and assumptions regarding maturity and recruitment regime for westernorigin fish were considered. Simulation of the operating model indicated considerable stock mixing in the western and central Atlantic, which resulted in differences between the stock and population view of western bluefin tuna. The relative biomass of the western population and its spatial and temporal distribution in the Atlantic was sensitive to model assumptions and configurations. Simulation modeling can provide a means to ascertain the potential consequences of stock mixing on the assessment and management of fishery resources.},

The model is tested with independent data on H. comma and P. argus, for which it predicts the rate and pattern of spread into networks of vacant habitat patches following introduction or natural recolonization. The model can be used to assess the potential of specific networks of habitat patches to support viable metapopulations of given species, and it therefore has great potential value for conservation of butterflies and other species which occur as systems of interconnected small populations. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {After near extinction as a result of the fur trade in the 1700s and 1800s, the southern sea otter slowly reoccupied the core of its range in central California. Range expansion beyond central California is seen as key to full recovery of otters, but the rate of expansion has been sporadic, raising concerns about habitat quality in southern California. To describe the range expansion of sea otters from central into southern California, we used skiff surveys, aerial surveys, and archival time-depth recorders from 2004 to 2013. These observations show that range expansion began when male otters swam southeast of Point Conception (Cojo Anchorage), perhaps to seek refuge from bad weather and to feed on unexploited resources. After several years of seasonal use by male groups, females began to use the area, leading to reproduction and a secondary increase in abundance. In contrast, a second male group that moved farther down the coast to Coal Oil Point stalled and retreated. Such range expansion and contraction can be explained by the social nature of sea otters, which acts to slow dispersal away from groups. Otter densities at Cojo Anchorage are now approaching equilibrium levels reported for central California. As in central California, otters rested in and near kelp forest habitat, but used deeper water for foraging. Together, these observations suggest habitat in the Santa Barbara Channel can still support sea otters, but range expansion of otters into southern California will be episodic due to social dynamics.

The "delisting" rule does not adequately address lack of genetic connectivity between Yellowstone wolf packs and other NRM populations, for which reason a federal court overturned the 2008 predecessor of the rule. The US Fish and Wildlife Service defies its own policies by delisting the Idaho and Montana portions of the DPS while Wyoming wolves remain endangered. Criteria for this delisting are inconsistent with prior delistings of recovered birds and mammals. New scientific understanding of species recovery argues for a higher delisting threshold for the NRM gray wolf metapopulation. Finally, we argue that ecosystem recovery should be a recovery criterion for this unique keystone predator. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological. Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the spatial scale of population structure is fundamental to long-standing tenets of population biology, landscape ecology and conservation. Nonetheless, identifying such scales has been challenging because a key factor that influences scaling – movement among patches or local populations – is a multicausal process with substantial phenotypic and temporal variation. 2. We resolve this problem via a novel application of network modularity. When applied to move-ments, modularity provides a formal description of the functional aggregation of populations and identifies potentially critical scales for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We first test for mod-ularity using several different types of biologically relevant movements across the entire geographic range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). We then ask whether variation in movement based on (i) age, (ii) sex and (iii) time (annual, seasonal and within-season movements) influences spatial population structure (i.e. modularity) in snail kites. 3. We identified significant modularity in annual dispersal of snail kites (all adults, males only, females only, and juveniles only) and in within-breeding season movements of adults, yet no evidence of modularity in seasonal (non-breeding) movements. For those movements with observed modular structure, we found striking similarities in the spatial configuration of population structure, even though movement properties varied considerably among these dif-ferent types of movements. 4. Our results suggest that the emergence of modularity in population networks can be robust despite movement heterogeneity and differences in patch-based measures of connectivity. Fur-thermore, our comparison of the population structure and connectivity across multiple move-ment phases helps to identify wetland patches most critical to population connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales. 5. We argue that understanding modularity in populations may provide a robust complement to existing measures of population structure and connectivity and will help to clarify the lim-iting roles of movement for populations. Such information is increasingly needed for inter-preting population persistence and guiding effective conservation strategies with ongoing environmental change.},

abstract = {Unraveling the relationship between demographic declines and genetic changes over time is of critical importance to predict the persistence of at-risk populations and to propose efficient conservation plans. This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a ‘reservoir' of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context.},

abstract = {Conservation scientists rarely have the information required to understand changes in abundance over more than a few decades, even for important species like Pacific salmon. Such lack of historical information can underestimate the magnitude of decline for depressed populations. We applied genetic tools to a unique collection of 100-year-old salmon scales to reveal declines of 56%–99% in wild sockeye populations across Canada's second largest salmon watershed, the Skeena River. These analyses reveal century-long declines that are much greater than those based on modern era abundance data, which suggested that only 7 of 13 populations declined over the last five decades. Populations of larger-bodied fish have declined the most in abundance, likely because of size-selective commercial fisheries. Our findings illustrate how a deep historical perspective can expand our understanding of past abundances to a time before species incurred significant losses from fishing, and help inform conservation for diminished populations.},

abstract = {Parametric and nonparametric kernel methods dominate studies of animal home ranges and space use. Most existing methods are unable to incorporate information about the underlying physical environment, leading to poor performance in excluding areas that are not used. Using radio-telemetry data from sea otters, we developed and evaluated a new algorithm for estimating home ranges (hereafter Permissible Home Range Estimation, or "PHRE") that reflects habitat suitability. We began by transforming sighting locations into relevant landscape features (for sea otters, coastal position and distance from shore). Then, we generated a bivariate kernel probability density function in landscape space and back-transformed this to geographic space in order to define a permissible home range. Compared to two commonly used home range estimation methods, kernel densities and local convex hulls, PHRE better excluded unused areas and required a smaller sample size. Our PHRE method is applicable to species whose ranges are restricted by complex physical boundaries or environmental gradients and will improve understanding of habitat-use requirements and, ultimately, aid in conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner-recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner-recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

Here we report a study on experimental root vole populations, where estimate of demographic parameters were contrasted between source patches in source-sink (treatment) and source-source systems (control). In the presence of a sink patch (simulated by a pulsed removal of immigrants), source-patch populations failed to increase over the breeding season, mainly due to a high spatially density-dependent dispersal rate from source to sink patches. The <i>per capita</i> recruitment rate was almost two times higher in source-sink than in the source-source system, but this did not compensate for the loss rate due to dispersal from source to sink patches. Sex ratio in the source-sink systems became less female biased, probably a result of an enhanced frequency of dispersal movements in femals.

abstract = {Understanding dispersal and habitat selection behaviours is central to many problems in ecology, evolution and conservation. One factor often hypothesized to influence habitat selection by dispersers is the natal environment experienced by juveniles. Nonetheless, evidence for the effect of natal environment on dispersing, wild vertebrates remains limited. Using 18 years of nesting and mark-resight data across an entire North American geographical range of an endangered bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), we tested for natal effects on breeding-site selection by dispersers and its consequences for reproductive success and population structure. Dispersing snail kites were more likely to nest in wetlands of the same habitat type (lacustrine or palustrine) as their natal wetland, independent of dispersal distance, but this preference declined with age and if individuals were born during droughts. Importantly, dispersing kites that bred in natal-like habitats had lower nest success and productivity than kites that did not. These behaviours help explain recently described population connectivity and spatial structure across their geographical range and reveal that assortative breeding is occurring, where birds are more likely to breed with individuals born in the same wetland type as their natal habitat. Natal environments can thus have long-term and large-scale effects on populations in nature, even in highly mobile animals.},

abstract = {1. The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations. 2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature. 3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities. 4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors.

abstract = {The SLOSS (single large or several small) debate is no longer an issue in the discussion about the optimal size of nature reserves. The best way to estimate the minimum sizes of reserves may be a three-step process: (1) identify target or keystone species whose disappearance would significantly decrease the value or species diversity of the reserve; (2) determine the minimum number of individuals in a population needed to guarantee a high probability of survival for these species; (3) using known densities, estimate the area needed to sustain the minimum number. The forces that affect population viability and determine MVPs (minimum viable populations) are extremely complex. Thoughtful estimates of MVPs for many animal species are rarely lower than an effective size of a few hundred. Attempts to save only common or smaller species in a community will usually be ill-fated because of the web of ecological relationships between species, including the importance of predation and herbivory in the maintenance of species diversity. Other topics discussed include the complementarity of conservation goals, the problematic function of corridors and the value of buffer zones. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Density dependence has been observed in overall spring/summer Snake River Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha production, but it is not clear how patterns observed at the aggregate level relate to individual populations within the basin. We used a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to explore the degree of density dependence in juvenile production for nine Idaho populations. Our results indicate that density dependence is ubiquitous, although its strength varies between populations. We also investigated the processes driving the population-level pattern and found density-dependent growth and mortality present for both common life-history strategies, but no evidence of density-dependent movement. Overwinter mortality, spatial clustering of redds and limited resource availability were identified as potentially important limiting factors contributing to density dependence. The ubiquity of density dependence for these threatened populations is alarming as stability at present low abundance levels suggests recovery may be difficult without major changes. We conclude that density dependence at the population level is common and must be considered in demographic analysis and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {The degradation of habitats due to human activities is a major topic of interest for the conservation and management of wild populations. There is growing evidence that the Florida Everglades ecosystem continues to suffer from habitat degradation. After a period of recovery in the 1990s, the Snail Kite Rostrhamus sociabilis population suffered a substantial decline in 2001 and has not recovered since. Habitat degradation has been suggested as one of the primary reasons for this lack of recovery. As a consequence of the continued degradation of the Everglades, we hypothesized that this would have led to increased movement of juvenile Kites over time, as a consequence of the need to find more favourable habitat. We used multistate mark-recapture models to compare between-site movement probabilities of juvenile Snail Kites in the 1990s (1992-95; which corresponds to the period before the decline) and 2000s (2003-06; after the decline). Our analyses were based on an extensive radiotelemetry study (266 birds tracked monthly over the entire state of Florida for a total period of 6 years) and considered factors such as sex and age of marked individuals. There was evidence of increased movement of juvenile Snail Kites during the post-decline period from most of the wetland regions used historically by Kites. Higher movement rates may contribute to an increase in the probability of mortality of young individuals and could contribute to the observed declines. -{\textregistered} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Recent surveys of recovery plans indicate that criteria, such as population sizes, for delisting species from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) are often unrealistically low by scientific standards. We describe the delisting criterion for the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) developed by the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Team. A major oil spill is the most serious threat to this sea otter population. After extensive modeling of oil spills, the recovery team concluded that it was not scientifically defensible to develop a delisting criterion in terms of a single probability of extinction over a specified time period. Instead, the team decided to define a size at which it would consider the population endangered and to consider the population threatened as long as a major oil spill might reduce it to that size. The effective population size (N(c)) for endangered status was set at 500, estimated to be about 1850 otters. Using a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez spill (250,000 bbl), the oil spill model was iterated to generate a frequency distribution of the number of sea otters contacted by oil, from which the team estimated that less than 800 otters would be killed by 90% of the simulated spills. Thus, the delisting criterion was set at 1850 + 800 = 2650 individuals. There have been several proposals to improve the Endangered Species Act by providing quantitative guidance, in the form of specific probabilities of extinction within some time frame or specific criteria like those used by the World Conservation Union as to the levels of extinction risk represented by the terms 'threatened' and 'endangered.' Experiences of the Sea Otter Recovery Team indicate that guidelines should not be overly rigid and should allow flexibility for dealing with specific situations. The most important consideration is to appoint a recovery team that is both technically well qualified and unconstrained by pressures from management agencies.},

abstract = {Despite broad recognition of the potential for significant spatial complexity in morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (. Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations.},

abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is currently managed as two separate eastern and western stocks, despite information indicating considerable stock mixing. Using a simulation model, we explored how scenarios of population-specific migration and uncertainty in aspects of bluefin tuna biology affect the magnitude, distribution, and mixed stock nature of the resource and catch of its associated fisheries. The analytical framework was a stochastic, age-structured, stock-overlap model that was seasonally and spatially explicit with movement of eastern- and western-origin tuna informed by tagging and otolith chemistry data. Alternate estimates of movement and assumptions regarding maturity and recruitment regime for westernorigin fish were considered. Simulation of the operating model indicated considerable stock mixing in the western and central Atlantic, which resulted in differences between the stock and population view of western bluefin tuna. The relative biomass of the western population and its spatial and temporal distribution in the Atlantic was sensitive to model assumptions and configurations. Simulation modeling can provide a means to ascertain the potential consequences of stock mixing on the assessment and management of fishery resources.},

This model yields a simple, but insightful, framework from which one can investigate factors that contribute to the evolution of resource exploitation patterns over space and time.

Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3% of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6%, the mixed hypothesis 30.5%, and the random hypothesis 12.6%. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes.},

Two linked components of stability have large consequences for persistence: first, statistical stability as the lack of temporal fluctuations; second, synchronisation as an aspect of dynamic stability, which erodes metapopulation rescue effects. Here, we determine the influence of river network structure on the stability of riverine metapopulations. We introduce an approach that converts river networks to metapopulation networks, and analytically show how fluctuation magnitude is influenced by interaction structure. We show that river metapopulation complexity (in terms of branching prevalence) has nonlinear dampening effects on population fluctuations, and can also buffer against synchronisation. We conclude by showing that river transects generally increase synchronisation, while the spatial scale of interaction has nonlinear effects on synchronised dynamics. Our results indicate that this dual stability - conferred by fluctuation and synchronisation dampening - emerges from interaction structure in rivers, and this may strongly influence the persistence of river metapopulations.},

The latter theory largely replaced the former one in the 1980s, especially in conservation applications. It is only recently that ecologists have fully realized that a relatively simple general theory can be readily constructed that makes some of the simplifying assumptions of the two earlier theories unnecessary. The spatially realistic metapopulation theory thereby provides a more unified framework for spatial ecology than the island theory or the classical metapopulation theory. This article describes the application of the spatially realistic metapopulation theory to real metapopulations living in highly fragmented landscapes.

abstract = {1.  Geostatistical data—spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon— are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.

2.  Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package's use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.

3.  We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).

4.  We hope that sdmTMB's user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.

However, many efforts toward ocean recovery remain unsuccessful, in part because marine ecosystems and the human societies that depend upon them are constantly changing. Furthermore, recovery efforts are embedded in marine social-ecological systems where large-scale dynamics can inhibit recovery. We argue that the ways forward are to (i) rethink an inclusive definition of recovery that embraces a diversity of stakeholder perspectives about acceptable recovery goals and ecosystem outcomes; (ii) encourage research that enables anticipation of feasible recovery states and identifies pathways toward resilient ecosystems; and (iii) adopt policies that are sufficiently nimble to keep pace with rapid change and governance that works seamlessly from local to regional scales. Application of these principles can facilitate successful recoveries in a world where environmental conditions and social imperatives are constantly shifting.},

While previous efforts to describe homing, or natal site fidelity, of migratory organisms have been hindered by the confounding effects of fragmented landscapes and management practices, realistic conservation efforts must include considerations of the behavioral diversity represented by animal movements and dispersal. Herein, we quantify straying away from natal origins by adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in a wild population that inhabits a pristine wilderness basin. Using natural isotopic signatures (87Sr/ 86Sr) to reconstruct the migratory behaviors of unhandled individuals over their entire life cycle, we identified ecological and behavioral factors influencing the propensity to stray. Our results indicate that natal site fidelity is scale dependent, ranging from 55% at ∼1-km distances to 87% at longer (>10-km scale) distances, and juvenile dispersal and sex highly influence straying occurrence. These findings lend support for the conservation of behavioral diversity for population persistence, and we propose straying as a mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity at low population densities. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary causes of dispersal can be crucial in understanding the behaviour of spatially structured populations, and predicting how species respond to environmental change. Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term ‚{\"{A}}{\`{o}}dispersal‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}, for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.},

abstract = {1. Spatial within-population heterogeneity in density probably affects competition intensity and may have a fundamental role in shaping population dynamics and carrying capacity. This may be particularly relevant for organisms where limitations on juvenile mobility cause maternal choice of breeding locations to influence the spatial distribution of younger life stages. 2. In this study, we mapped redd locations and the resulting densities of juveniles the following year along the entire reach (9{\textperiodcentered}2km) of a river holding natural populations of anadromous salmonids (Atlantic salmon and brown trout). These data were used to quantify the spatial scale over which breeding influences juvenile densities, and hence becomes important for density-dependent processes. 3. Although the observed cumulative distributions indicated a relatively uniform distribution of breeding along the river, autocorrelation analyses identified spatial patchiness of both breeding and resulting juveniles on a local scale. Furthermore, cross-correlations suggested a close spatial relationship between distribution of redds and juveniles. 4. Using spatially explicit hockey-stick stock-recruitment functions, we found juvenile salmonid density to be mostly influenced by the amount of breeding upstream of a given location. This influence decreased rapidly within the first 75-150 m. Thus, female choice with regard to breeding location gave rise to a heterogeneous distribution of offspring on a spatial scale of almost two orders of magnitude finer than that of the whole population (9{\textperiodcentered}2km). 5. The results are consistent with smaller scale experimental studies of salmonids, and emphasize the role for maternal choice of breeding locations in causing substantial spatial heterogeneity in juvenile densities within natural populations. Due to effects of density heterogeneity on overall levels of competition, this adds another layer of complexity to the dynamics of salmonid populations even in populations where breeding appears to be relatively uniformly distributed through space, and potentially also for a range of other organisms where juvenile dispersal is constrained. {\textcopyright}2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third, measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition. Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

Both theory and empirical information support the conclusion that most density-de-pendent change occurs at high population levels (close to the carrying capacity) for species with life history strategies typical of large mammals. The reverse is true for species with life history strategies typical of insects and some fishes. Theoretical considerations that give rise to these conclusions involve natural selection and trophic dynamics. There is a large body of literature that contains descriptions of density dependence as based on empirical observations. These data, and the models used to represent them, indicate that species with high reproductive rates, short life-spans and pop-ulations held below the limits of environmental resources exhibit most density-dependent change at low population levels. Similar data for species with low reproductive rates, long life-spans and pop-ulations that are more limited by resources (large mammals in particular) indicate that most density-dependent changes in vital rates occur at levels of the population quite close to the carrying capacity.},

In the Northeast Pacific, the recovery of sea otters Enhydra lutris following their extirpation due to the 18th and 19th century fur trade is driving a social-ecological regime shift with profound implications. While the ecological consequences of this shift are well documented, very little research has examined the conditions that enable or constrain people's ability to adapt to the social, economic and cultural changes that transpire. 2. Through a collaborative partnership and workshops with Indigenous knowledge holders spanning Alaska to British Columbia, along with quantitative and qualitative interviews in two Indigenous communities among the first to experience sea otter recovery, we examined people's perceptions of the social-ecological conditions that affect their ability to adapt to these changes. 3. We found that communities differed in their relative rankings of adaptation-enabling conditions; however, the following four broad strategies were perceived as critical to improving coexistence with sea otters: (a) strengthening Indigenous gov-ernance and decision-making authority; (b) promoting adaptive co-management; (c) weaving Indigenous knowledge and Western science into management plans and (d) establishing learning platforms. Both communities also identified that increased livelihood options and financial assistance would not compensate for lost food security. 4. Differences in enabling conditions and attitudes towards sea otters within and between communities can be attributed to the social-ecological and political context in which sea otter recovery occurs. 5. Our study suggests that enhancing Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to predator induced regime shifts will require a transformation in current resource},

abstract = {Without seeking independent scientific review, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar recently approved a 14 January 2009 Bush administration rule to remove endangered species protection from the northern Rocky Mountain (NRM.) Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of gray wolves less than 14 years after their reintroduction to Idaho and Wyoming. The "delisting" rule does not adequately address lack of genetic connectivity between Yellowstone wolf packs and other NRM populations, for which reason a federal court overturned the 2008 predecessor of the rule. The US Fish and Wildlife Service defies its own policies by delisting the Idaho and Montana portions of the DPS while Wyoming wolves remain endangered. Criteria for this delisting are inconsistent with prior delistings of recovered birds and mammals. New scientific understanding of species recovery argues for a higher delisting threshold for the NRM gray wolf metapopulation. Finally, we argue that ecosystem recovery should be a recovery criterion for this unique keystone predator. {\textcopyright} 2009 by American Institute of Biological. Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many organisms exhibit tremendous fluctuations in population abundance and experience unexpected collapse. Conservationists seeking to minimize region-wide variability in resources and reduce extinction risk often seek to preserve a metapopulation portfolio of spatially asynchronous subpopulations connected by dispersal. However, portfolio properties are not necessarily static, and the erosion of a portfolio can fundamentally alter the population dynamics and services a species provides. In the Northeast Pacific, a portfolio of spatially asynchronous herring populations has historically provided regional reliability of herring to mobile predators and commercial fishermen as well as local subsistence and ceremonial harvest. Here, we fit a mechanistic time-series model to herring spawn and catch records from 1950 to 2015 to quantify how population growth, climate, and fishing have contributed to a major shift in the herring portfolio over time. We document the erosion of the herring portfolio and a severe decline in herring population growth. Commercial harvest historically played a key role in herring dynamics, hovering around typical annual exploitation rates (15%) at the archipelago scale, but local harvest rates were much higher when fishing occurred (as high as 65%). Additionally, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and population growth had equally strong effects on local and regional herring population dynamics. Our results highlight how spatially structured populations can undergo major shifts following disturbance and emphasize how ecological systems do not always rapidly recover and provide services following disturbance. Developing herring management strategies at a finer scale may ensure greater regional resource reliability by recovering previous levels of spatial population asynchrony. However, doing so may require higher implementation and monitoring costs in order to yield higher ecological, social, and economic benefits. Such place-based solutions that match the spatial scale of governance to the spatial scale of ecological dynamics have the potential to improve future management and conservation in an increasingly dynamic world.},

abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

abstract = {Current debates about the efficacy of no-take marine reserves (MR) in protecting large pelagic fish such as tuna and sharks have usually not considered the evolutionary dimension of this issue, which emerges because the propensity to swim away from a given place, like any other biological trait, will probably vary in a heritable fashion among individuals. Here, based on spatially explicit simulations, we investigated whether selection to remain in MRs to avoid higher fishing mortality can lead to the evolution of more philopatric fish. Our simulations, which covered a range of life histories among tuna species (skipjack tuna vs. Atlantic bluefin tuna) and shark species (great white sharks vs. spiny dogfish), suggested that MRs were most effective at maintaining viable population sizes when movement distances were lowest. Decreased movement rate evolved following the establishment of marine reserves, and this evolution occurred more rapidly with higher fishing pressure. Evolutionary reductions in movement rate led to increases in within-reserve population sizes over the course of the 50 years following MR establishment, although this varied among life histories, with skipjack responding fastest and great white sharks slowest. Our results suggest the evolution of decreased movement can augment the efficacy of marine reserves, especially for species, such as skipjack tuna, with relatively short generation times. Even when movement rates did not evolve substantially over 50 years (e.g., given long generation times or little heritable variation), marine reserves were an effective tool for the conservation of fish populations when mean movement rates were low or MRs were large.},

abstract = {Trends in abundance of spring and summer chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Salmo gairdneri returning to the Snake River and mid-Columbia River above Priest Rapids Dam were determined by analyzing the percentage of adults returning from the smolt out-migrations of 1962–1984. Runs declined as a result of hydroelectric development of the river; the main cause for the decline was the mortality of juveniles migrating downstream through as many as nine dams and impoundments en route to the ocean. Mid-Columbia River summer chinook salmon runs experienced the greatest decline because of higher mortalities incurred during their migration to sea as subyearlings in July and August. Mortality was lower for remaining races of fish that migrate to sea as yearlings in the spring during higher river flows, more spill at dams, and cooler water temperatures. Enhancement measures to offset dam-related mortality of smolts began in 1970 on the Snake River and in 1975 on the mid-Columbia River. These measures included increased numbers of smolts released from hatcheries, spillway deflectors to reduce dissolved gas saturation, fingerling bypasses at dams, transportation of smolts around dams, supplemental river flows to minimize delay for smolts passing through reservoirs, and supplemental spill at dams to minimize turbine mortality of smolts at dams without fingerling bypasses. These actions have reversed the decline of steelhead but not of salmon. Enhancement has improved the rate of return of wild spring chinook salmon, but wild fish contribution is minimal at this time because stocks were reduced by earlier hydroelectric development. Presently, runs are mostly of hatchery origin and have not responded well to enhancement. Mortality of hatchery fish may be due to activation of bacterial kidney disease by stresses encountered during downriver migrations, transportation, or subsequent transition into seawater.},

abstract = {Unanticipated declines among exploited species have commonly occurred despite harvests that appeared sustainable prior to collapse. This is particularly true in the oceans where spatial scales of management are often mismatched with spatially complex metapopulations. We explore causes, consequences, and potential solutions for spatial mismatches in harvested metapopulations in three ways. First, we generate novel theory illustrating when and how harvesting metapopulations increases spatial variability and in turn masks local-scale volatility. Second, we illustrate why spatial variability in harvested metapopulations leads to negative consequences using an empirical example of a Pacific herring metapopulation. Finally, we construct a numerical management strategy evaluation model to identify and highlight potential solutions for mismatches in spatial scale and spatial variability. Our results highlight that spatial complexity can promote stability at large scales, however, ignoring spatial complexity produces cryptic and negative consequences for people and animals that interact with resources at small scales. Harvesting metapopulations magnifies spatial variability, which creates discrepancies between regional and local trends while increasing risk of local population collapses. Such effects asymmetrically impact locally constrained fishers and predators, which are more exposed to risks of localized collapses. Importantly, we show that dynamically optimizing harvest can minimize local risk without sacrificing yield. Thus, multiple nested scales of management may be necessary to avoid cryptic collapses in metapopulations and the ensuing ecological, social, and economic consequences.},

abstract = {Management of spatially structured species poses unique challenges. Despite a strong theoretical foundation, practitioners rarely have sufficient empirical data to evaluate how populations interact. Rather, assumptions about connectivity and source–sink dynamics are often based on incomplete, extrapolated, or modeled data, if such interactions are even considered at all. Therefore, it has been difficult to evaluate whether spatially structured species are meeting conservation goals. We evaluated how estimated metapopulation structure responded to estimates of population sizes and dispersal probabilities and to the set of populations included. We then compared outcomes of alternative management strategies that target conservation of metapopulation processes. We illustrated these concepts for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Snake River, USA. Our description of spatial structure for this metapopulation was consistent with previous characterizations. We found substantial differences in estimated metapopulation structure when we had incomplete information about all populations and when we used different sources of data (three empirical, two modeled) to estimate dispersal, whereas responses to population size estimates were more consistent. Together, these findings suggest that monitoring efforts should target all populations occasionally and populations that play key roles frequently and that multiple types of data should be collected when feasible. When empirical data are incomplete or of uneven quality, analyses using estimates produced from an ensemble of available datasets can help conservation planners and managers weigh near-term options. Doing so, we found trade-offs in connectivity and source dominance in metapopulation-level responses to alternative management strategies that suggest which types of approaches may be inherently less risky.},

Legal challenges to recovery plans (see Fund for Animals v. Babbitt, 903 F.

Reserves, or no-take areas, have been proposed as a management tool for reducing fisheries-induced selection, but their effectiveness for migratory species has remained unexplored. Here we develop an eco-genetic model to predict the effects of marine reserves on fisheries-induced evolution under migration. To represent a stock that undergoes an annual migration between feeding and spawning grounds, we draw model parameters from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the northern part of its range. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) a reserve in a stock's feeding grounds, protecting immature and mature fish alike, reduces fisheries-induced evolution, even though protected and unprotected population components mix on the spawning grounds; (ii) in contrast, a reserve in a stock's spawning grounds, protecting only mature fish, has little mitigating effects on fisheries-induced evolution and can sometimes even exacerbate its magnitude; (iii) evolutionary changes that are already underway may be difficult to reverse with a reserve; (iv) directly after a reserve is created or enlarged, most reserve scenarios result in yield losses; and (v) timescale is very important: short-term yield losses immediately after a reserve's creation can give way to long-term gains. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {We use an individual-based, spatially realistic metapopulation model to study the evolution of migration rate. We first explore the consequences of habitat change in hypothetical patch networks on a regular lattice. If the primary consequence of habitat change is an increase in local extinction risk as a result of decreased local population sizes, migration rate increases. A nonmonotonic response, with migration rate decreasing at high extinction rate, was obtained only by assuming very frequent catastrophes. If the quality of the matrix habitat deteriorates, leading to increased mortality during migration, the evolutionary response is more complex. As long as habitat patch occupancy does not decrease markedly with increased migration mortality, reduced migration rate evolves. However, once mortality becomes so high that empty patches remain uncolonized for a long time, evolution tends to increase migration rate, which may lead to an "evolutionary rescue" in a fragmented landscape. Kin competition has a quantitative effect on the evolution of migration rate in our model, but these patterns in the evolution of migration rate appear to be primarily caused by spatiotemporal variation in fitness and mortality during migration. We apply the model to real habitat patch networks occupied by two checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea) species, for which sufficient data are available to estimate rigorously most of the model parameters. The model-predicted migration rate is not significantly different from the empirically observed one. Regional variation in patch areas and connectivities leads to regional variation in the optimal migration rate, predictions that can be tested empirically.},

abstract = {An enduring challenge for ecology is identifying the drivers of ecosystem and population stability. In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system's response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.},

abstract = {The spatial dispersal of individuals is known to play an important role in the dynamics of populations, and is central to metapopulation theory. At the same time, local adaptation to environmental conditions creates a geographic mosaic of evolutionary forces, where the combined drivers of selection and gene flow interact. Although the dispersal of individuals from donor to recipient populations provides connections within the metapopulation, promoting demographic and evolutionary rescue, it may also introduce maladapted individuals into habitats host to different environmental conditions, potentially lowering the fitness of the recipient population. Here we explore a model of the eco-evolutionary dynamics between two populations connected by dispersal, where the productivity of each is defined by a trait complex that is subject to local selection. Although general in nature, our model is inspired by salmon metapopulations, where dispersal between populations is defined in terms of the straying rate, which has been shown to be density-dependent. The results of our model reveal that increased straying between evolving populations leads to alternative stable states, which has large and nonlinear effects on two measures of metapopulation robustness: the portfolio effect and the time to recovery following an induced disturbance. We show that intermediate levels of straying result in large gains in robustness, and that increased habitat heterogeneity promotes robustness when straying rates are low, and erodes robustness when straying rates are high. Finally, we show that density-dependent straying promotes robustness, particularly when the aggregate biomass is low and straying is correspondingly high, which has important ramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both natural and anthropogenic disturbances.},

abstract = {Although southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) are not considered prey for white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), sharks do nonetheless bite sea otters. We analyzed spatial and temporal trends in shark bites on sea otters in California, assessing the frequency of shark bite wounds in 1,870 carcasses collected since 1985. The proportion of stranded sea otters having shark bites has increased sharply since 2003, and white shark bites now account for >50% of recovered carcasses. The trend was most pronounced in the southern part of the range, from Estero Bay to Point Conception, where shark bite frequency has increased eightfold. Seasonal trends were also evident: most shark-bitten carcasses are recovered in late summer and fall; however, the period of elevated shark bite frequency has lengthened. The causes of these trends are unclear, but possible contributing factors include increased white shark abundance and/or changes in white shark behavior and distribution. In particular, the spatiotemporal patterns of shark-bitten sea otters match increases in pinniped populations, and the increased availability of marine mammal prey for white sharks may have led to more sharks spending more time in nearshore waters utilized by both sea otters and pinnipeds.},

abstract = {Conservation and management increasingly focus on connectivity, because connectivity driven by variation in immigration rates across landscapes is thought to be crucial for maintaining local population and metapopulation persistence. Yet, efforts to quantify the relative role of immigration on population growth across the entire range of species and over time have been lacking. We assessed whether immigration limited local and range-wide population growth of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA, over 18 years using multi-state, reverse-time modelling that accounts for imperfect detection of individuals and unobservable states. Demographic contributions of immigration varied depending on the dynamics and geographic position of the local populations, were scale-dependent and changed over time. By comparing the relative contributions of immigration versus local demography for periods of significant change in local abundance, we found empirical evidence for a disproportionately large role of immigration in facilitating population growth of a centrally located population—a connectivity ‘hub'. The importance of connectivity changed depending of the spatial scale considered, such that immigration was a more important driver of population growth at small versus large spatial scales. Furthermore, the contribution of immigration was much greater during time periods when local population size was small, emphasizing abundance-dependent rescue effects. Our findings suggest that efforts aimed at improving local breeding habitat will likely be most effective at increasing snail kite population growth. More broadly, our results provide much needed information on the role of connectivity for population growth, suggesting that connectivity conservation may have the greatest benefits when efforts focus on centrally located habitat patches and small populations. Furthermore, our results highlight that connectivity is highly dynamic over time and that interpreting the effects of connectivity at local scales may not transfer to region-wide dynamics.},

abstract = {Highly valued, hunted, managed, and traded by indigenous people for at least 12,000 years, sea otters share a deep history of interactions with humans along North America's northwest coast. Yet the nineteenth century extirpation and subsequent recovery of sea otters triggered profound ecological, cultural, and socio-economic transformations that continue to elicit complex trade-offs that coastal communities grapple with today. To expand our understanding of past baselines, future recovery targets, and the role First Nations in British Columbia and Alaska once played in altering and managing coastal resources, including sea otters, we synthesized evidence from archeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional knowledge, and contemporary ecological research. Archeological evidence suggests that sea otter hunting was a significant and widespread practice among aboriginal people in this area throughout the Holocene, although the magnitude of use varied spatially. Furthermore, isotopic evidence suggests that over the millennia, sea otters may have been reduced in numbers, existing below carrying capacity, and excluded near human settlements. Furthermore, traditional knowledge and historical records reveal that indigenous peoples of the northwest coast developed diverse technologies to conserve and manage coastal marine resources, such as selective harvesting, seasonal restrictions on use or consumption, and proprietorship that was contingent on sustained productivity. Ancient marine tenure systems and governance protocols based on reciprocity were used to conserve and spatially manage most marine species, including sea otters. Current First Nations perspectives on sea otter conservation and management vary among people and through time as sea otter population status changes, as communities adapt to this perturbation, and as new legal frameworks supporting First Nations rights to co-management emerge.},

We develop a non-age-structured biomass model of spatially independent spawning sites with local density dependence, based on Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). We compare a diffusion (DIFF) strategy, where recruits adopt spawning sites near their natal site without regard to older fish, with GWOF, where recruits adopt the same spawning sites, but in proportion to the abundance of adults using those sites. In both models, older individuals return to their previous spawning site. The GWOF model leads to higher spatial variance in biomass. As total mortality increases, the DIFF strategy results in an approximately proportional decrease in biomass among spawning sites, whereas the GWOF strategy results in abandonment of less productive sites and maintenance of high biomass at more productive sites. A DIFF strategy leads to dynamics comparable to non-spatially structured populations. While the aggregate response of the GWOF strategy is distorted, non-stationary and slow to equilibrate, with a production curve that is distinctly flattened and relatively unproductive. These results indicate that fishing will disproportionately affect populations with GWOF behaviour.},

abstract = {Mixed-stock fisheries simultaneously exploit populations that may differ in their conservation status, and uncertainty in stock-specific harvest rates can hamper evaluations of recovery prospects for depressed populations. These difficulties are exemplified in the Sockeye Salmon population from the Atnarko watershed, which collapsed in the early 2000s, causing cultural and economic hardship. A recovery plan identified the incidental harvest of Sockeye Salmon by mixed-stock fisheries in the Atnarko as a potential, but poorly understood, impediment to recovery. We reconstructed harvest rates for salmon in Indigenous and commercial fisheries and used an age-structured state-space model of stock–recruit dynamics to predict how a range of future mixed-stock harvest rates would influence recovery. Under recent harvest rates, there is a 50–60% chance that the population will grow to exceed a recovery goal of 15,000 spawners over the next four generations. Eliminating the harvest of Sockeye Salmon altogether increased predicted recovery prospects to a maximum of 69%, suggesting that factors other than fisheries are contributing to the lack of recovery (e.g., ocean conditions) and that harvest management alone is unlikely to lead to recovery with a high degree of certainty. We developed a generalized migration, harvest, and catch monitoring simulation model to quantify how different monitoring scenarios might improve estimates for mixed-stock harvest rates. Increasing the number of specimens collected for genetic samples improved the harvest rate estimates for each stock caught in the mixed-stock fisheries, particularly for the smallest stocks, and relative to single sampling events conducted near the peak of the return migration, weekly sampling improved estimates only slightly but provided insurance against missing the peak of the return migration. Our study highlights collaborative research initiated and directed by the Nuxalk Nation to promote the recovery of a depressed stock that is inherent to traditional foods, thereby contributing to a global effort to integrate Indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

Nevertheless, many monitoring programs do not effectively address primary sources of variability in monitoring data, which ultimately may limit the utility of monitoring in identifying declines and improving management. To illustrate the importance of taking into account detectability and spatial variation, we used a recently proposed estimator of abundance (superpopulation estimator) to estimate population size of and number of young produced by the Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) in Florida. During the last decade, primary recovery targets set by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Snail Kite that were based on deficient monitoring programs (i.e., uncorrected counts) were close to being met (by simply increasing search effort during count surveys). During that same period, the Snail Kite population declined dramatically (by 55% from 1997 to 2005) and the number of young decreased by 70% between 1992-1998 and 1999-2005. Our results provide a strong practical case in favor of the argument that investing a sufficient amount of time and resources into designing and implementing monitoring programs that carefully address detectability and spatial variation is critical for the conservation of endangered species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Movement is important for ecological and evolutionary theory as well as connectivity conservation, which is increasingly critical for species responding to environmental change. Key ecological and evolutionary outcomes of movement, such as population growth and gene flow, require effective dispersal: movement that is followed by successful reproduction. However, the relative roles of movement and postmovement reproduction for effective dispersal and connectivity remain unclear. Here we isolate the contributions of movement and immigrant reproduction to effective dispersal and connectivity across the entire breeding range of an endangered raptor, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). To do so, we unite mark-resight data on movement and reproduction across 9 years and 27 breeding patches with an integrated model that decomposes effective dispersal into its hierarchical levels of movement, postmovement breeding attempt, and postmovement reproductive success. We found that immigrant reproduction limits effective dispersal more than movement for this endangered species, demonstrating that even highly mobile species may have limited effective connectivity due to reduced immigrant reproduction. We found different environmental limitations for the reproductive component of effective dispersal compared with movement, indicating that different conservation strategies may be needed when promoting effective dispersal rather than movement alone. We also demonstrate that considering immigrant reproduction, rather than movement alone, alters which patches are the most essential for connectivity, thereby changing conservation priorities. These results challenge the assumption that understanding movement alone is sufficient to infer connectivity and highlight that connectivity conservation may require not only fostering movement but also successful reproduction of immigrants.},

abstract = {Natal homing is a hallmark of the life history of salmonid fishes, but the spatial scale of homing within local, naturally reproducing salmon populations is still poorly understood. Accurate homing (paired with restricted movement) should lead to the existence of fine-scale genetic structuring due to the spatial clustering of related individuals on spawning grounds. Thus, we explored the spatial resolution of natal homing using genetic associations among individual Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in an interconnected stream network. We also investigated the relationship between genetic patterns and two factors hypothesized to influence natal homing and localized movements at finer scales in this species, localized patterns in the distribution of spawning gravels and sex. Spatial autocorrelation analyses showed that spawning locations in both sub-basins of our study site were spatially clumped, but the upper sub-basin generally had a larger spatial extent and continuity of redd locations than the lower sub-basin, where the distribution of redds and associated habitat conditions were more patchy. Male genotypes were not autocorrelated at any spatial scale in either sub-basin. Female genotypes showed significant spatial autocorrelation and genetic patterns for females varied in the direction predicted between the two sub-basins, with much stronger autocorrelation in the sub-basin with less continuity in spawning gravels. The patterns observed here support predictions about differential constraints and breeding tactics between the two sexes and the potential for fine-scale habitat structure to influence the precision of natal homing and localized movements of individual Chinook salmon on their breeding grounds.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of $\sim$100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10% surface area protection from the current 1.8%. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.},

abstract = {Winter mortality has been documented in a large number of freshwater fish populations, and a smaller, but increasing, number of marine and estuarine fishes. The impacted populations include a number of important North American and European resource species, yet the sources of winter mortality remain unidentified in most populations where it has been documented. Among the potential sources, thermal stress and starvation have received the most research attention. Other sources including predation and pathogens have significant impacts but have received insufficient attention to date. Designs of more recent laboratory experiments have reflected recognition of the potential for interactions among these co-occurring stressors. Geographic patterns in winter mortality are, in some cases, linked to latitudinal clines in winter severity and variability. However, for many freshwater species in particular, the effects of local community structure (predators and prey) may overwhelm latitudinal patterns. Marine (and estuarine) systems differ from freshwater systems in several aspects important to overwintering fishes, the most important being the lack of isolating barriers in the ocean. While open population boundaries allow fish to adopt migration strategies minimizing exposure to thermal stresses, they may retard rates of evolution to local environments. Geographic patterns in the occurrence and causes of winter mortality are ultimately determined by the interaction of regional and local factors. Winter mortality impacts population dynamics through episodic depressions in stock size and regulation of annual cohort strength. While the former tends to act in a density-independent manner, the latter can be density dependent, as most sources of mortality tend to select against the smallest members of the cohort and population. Most stock assessment and management regimes have yet to explicitly incorporate the variability in winter mortality. Potential management responses include postponement of cohort evaluation (to after first winter of life), harvest restrictions following mortality events and habitat enhancement. Future research should place more emphasis on the ecological aspects of winter mortality including the influences of food-web structure on starvation and predation. Beyond illuminating an understudied life-history phase, studies of overwintering ecology are integral to contemporary issues in fisheries ecology including ecosystem management, habitat evaluation, and impacts of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

abstract = {Aim: Understanding the biodiversity–stability relationship has become a central issue in ecology and conservation biology. Although the stabilizing effects of tree species diversity on ecosystem productivity are well recorded in small local communities, they remain poorly understood across scales (from local to larger spatial scales). This study evaluates biodiversity–stability effects from local to larger spatial scales in a large temperate forest region, considering a range of environmental conditions and environmental heterogeneity. Location: North-eastern China (c. 700,000 km2). Time period: 2005–2017. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: We define stability as the temporal invariability of biomass productivity. Regional metacommunities representing larger spatial scales were developed by aggregating multiple sets of local field plots. Simple regression analysis was used to test biodiversity–stability relationships in metacommunities. Piecewise structural equation modelling was then used to disentangle the effects of diversity and abiotic variables on forest stability at local and larger spatial scales. Multiple mixed-effects regression models were used to determine the relative contribution of individual predictive variables to stability across spatial scales. Results: We found that local diversity (alpha diversity) was positively related to the stability of local communities (alpha stability), whereas species turnover across space (beta diversity) was positively related to asynchronous dynamics among local communities (spatial asynchrony), regardless of whether abiotic factors were considered or not. We also found that environmental conditions and environmental heterogeneity affected forest stability across scales. The effect of spatial asynchrony on gamma stability was greater than that of alpha stability. Main conclusions: Our results imply that spatial asynchrony is a key to maintaining the stability of ecosystem productivity within a large temperate forest region. We suggest that diverse forests and heterogeneous landscapes should be sustained at multiple spatial scales to buffer the negative effects of climate change and forest degradation.},

However, estimating recruitment in a stock assessment model involves the challenging task of identifying a self-sustaining population, which often includes representing complex geographic structure. A review of several case studies demonstrated that alternative stock assessment models can influence estimates of recruitment. Incorporating spatial population structure and connectivity into stock assessment models changed the perception of recruitment events for a wide diversity of fisheries, but the degree to which estimates were impacted depended on movement rates and relative stock sizes. For multiple population components, estimates of strong recruitment events and the productivity of smaller population units were often more sensitive to connectivity assumptions. Simulation testing, conditioned on these case studies, suggested that accurately accounting for population structure, either in management unit definitions or stock assessment model structure, improved recruitment estimates. An understanding of movement dynamics improved estimation of connected sub-populations. The challenge of representing geographic structure in stock assessment emphasizes the importance of defining self-sustaining management units to justify a unit-stock assumption.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are quickly gaining popularity as a management option for marine conservation, fisheries, and other human uses of the oceans. Despite the popularity of marine reserves as a management tool, few reserves appear to have been created or designed with an understanding of how reserves affect biological factors or how reserves can be designed to meet biological goals more effectively (e.g., attaining sustainable fish populations). This shortcoming occurs in part because the many studies that have examined the impacts of reserves on marine organisms remain isolated examples or anecdotes; the results of these many studies have not yet been synthesized. Here, I review the empirical work and discuss the theoretical literature to assess the impacts of marine reserves on several biological measures (density, biomass, size of organisms, and diversity), paying particular attention to the role reserve size has in determining those impacts. The results of 89 separate studies show that, on average, with the exception of invertebrate biomass and size, values for all four biological measures are significantly higher inside reserves compared to outside (or after reserve establishment vs. before) when evaluated for both the overall communities and by each functional group within these communities (carnivorous fishes, herbivorous fishes, planktivorous fishes/invertebrate eaters, and invertebrates). Surprisingly, results also show that the relative impacts of reserves, such as the proportional differences in density or biomass, are independent of reserve size, suggesting that the effects of marine reserves increase directly rather than proportionally with the size of a reserve. However, equal relative differences in biological measures between small and large reserves nearly always translate into greater absolute differences for larger reserves, and so larger reserves may be necessary to meet the goals set for marine reserves.

The quality of the data in the reviewed studies varied greatly. To improve data quality in the future, whenever possible, studies should take measurements before and after the creation of a reserve, replicate sampling, and include a suite of representative species. Despite the variable quality of the data, the results from this review suggest that nearly any marine habitat can benefit from the implementation of a reserve. Success of a marine reserve, however, will always be judged against the expectations for that reserve, and so we must keep in mind the goals of a reserve in its design, management, and evaluation.},

abstract = {In marine populations, spatial structure arises over a wide range of scales and forms hierarchical aggregations. Changing spatial structure can alter the demographic and life history trait variation within populations and subject individuals to both novel environmental conditions and interspecific interactions. Thus, changes in the spatial structure of marine populations can be a prelude to further changes in abundance and can affect the resilience and recovery potential of populations following anthropogenic and environmental perturbations. These observations under - score the importance of studying the spatial ecology of marine fish populations in order to (1) understand the underlying mechanisms that can lead to rapid alterations in population abundance and community interactions, (2) provide indicators of stock health, and (3) characterize the consequences of changing spatial patterns on population susceptibility to exploitation and environmental variability. Here, we synthesize the interacting factors that influence the formation, maintenance and erosion of spatial structure in marine fish populations and identify the further con sequences of such erosion at the population and community levels. We emphasize human driven changes of population spatial structure for 3 levels of population genetic aggregation that are common in fisheries management scenarios, namely sympatric populations, metapopulations and panmictic populations. Case studies are presented for each level of aggregation. Throughout our review, we both summarize the factors that link spatial and temporal dynamics in marine populations and highlight the management and conservation implications of such linkages. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

Using the estimated parameter values, transient dynamics and the equilibrium fraction of occupied patches in any system of habitat patches can be predicted. The significance of particular habitat patches for the long-term persistence of the metapopulation, for example, can also be evaluated. 4.

The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate).

@article{Warner1985,
abstract = {For most species, a changeable environment creates a situation in which recruitment varies considerably from one breeding season to the next. If adults survive well, an occasional favorable recruitment can sustain population numbers over long periods. In effect, the gains made in favorable periods are stored in the adult population. Storage is particularly important when the species is at low densities, because then the potential population growth rate is very high if a favorable period occurs. Our past work showed that the storage mechanism could lead to coexistence of two species in lottery competition for space, as long as generations overlapped and there was sufficient variation in recruitment (Chesson and Warner 1981). This was true even if one species had an average competitive advantage. The storage model also operates when more than two species are competing, when resources renew independently of population sizes, and when not all the resource is used. It also operates in simple Lotka-Volterra systems in which adults do not compete directly with juveniles. The field ecologist is faced with the more practical problem of determining whether the storage mechanism is operating in a particular system. Species with relatively long lives and high fecundities are most likely to enjoy the benefits of the storage effect. Environments that theoretically elicit these life history characteristics are relatively benign and permanent for established adults, but are such that births and/or juvenile survivorship vary widely. Trees and many marine organisms are examples of species with the proper life histories, and storage may be important in maintaining the high diversity of these communities. The storage mechanism is capable of independently maintaining species coexistence, and we provide some suggestions on how to distinguish qualitatively the operation of storage from alternative mechanisms. We expect, however, that storage will make some positive contribution toward species persistence in nearly all communities, and we give a method for estimating empirically how large that contribution is.},

abstract = {1. Habitat degradation is seriously threatening stream biodiversity and productivity world-wide. For salmonid fish, restoration projects in disturbed systems commonly aim at increasing the availability of suitable breeding habitats, but expectations of effects on population abundance based on explicit models are lacking. 2. We used a spatial population model to predict how breeder dispersion may influence population dynamics of salmonids. Simulations involved changing the relative abundance of habitat suitable for two juvenile size classes (small fry and larger parr), the type of density-dependent regulation (effects on survival only vs. effects on survival and growth) and intercohort competitive mechanisms. 3. Increased breeding dispersion could alter patterns of density-dependent mortality and increase equilibrium adult abundance and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, there was a strong interaction between stage-specific habitat abundance and breeding dispersion. The most pronounced effects of breeding dispersion were observed under intermediate levels of fry habitat abundance. 4. When fry habitat was abundant, density-dependent mortality was most intense during the parr stage, and increased breeding dispersion did not increase adult abundance or MSY. In fact, when populations were regulated in the parr stage, increased breeding dispersion could cause decreased adult abundance because of the effects of intercohort competition. This negative effect only occurred, however, when competition among juveniles was symmetric (no age or size advantage). 5. Synthesis and applications. The population effects of restoring breeding habitat can differ among environments, and we have demonstrated how these differences can be understood in the light of stage-specific density dependence. Increasing spatial dispersion of breeders may often be an efficient measure for conserving threatened populations and increasing yields in fished populations. However, if direct evidence or habitat considerations suggest that fish populations experience density-dependent mortality during the parr stage, attempts to increase abundance through increased breeding distribution or artificial stocking should be avoided, as these are likely to be ineffective or even detrimental. The difference between fishing rates providing maximum sustainable yield and extinction is particularly small for such populations, suggesting that fish managers should adopt a conservative and flexible regulation regime. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Sea otter populations in Southeast Alaska, USA, have increased dramatically from just over 400 translocated animals in the late 1960s to >8,000 by 2003. The recovery of sea otters to ecosystems from which they had been absent has affected coastal food webs, including commercially important fisheries, and thus information on expected growth and equilibrium abundances can help inform resource management. We compile available survey data for Southeast Alaska and fit a Bayesian state-space model to estimate past trends and current abundance. Our model improves upon previous analyses by partitioning and quantifying sources of estimation error, accounting for over-dispersion of aerial count data, and providing realistic measurements of uncertainty around point estimates of abundance at multiple spatial scales. We also provide estimates of carrying capacity (K) for Southeast Alaska, at regional and sub-regional scales, and analyze growth rates, current population status and expected future trends. At the regional scale, the population increased from 13,221 otters in 2003 to 25,584 otters in 2011. The average annual growth rate in southern Southeast Alaska (7.8%) was higher than northern Southeast Alaska (2.7%); however, growth varied at the sub-regional scale and there was a negative relationship between growth rates and the number of years sea otters were present in an area. Local populations vary in terms of current densities and expected future growth; the mean estimated density at K was 4.2 ± 1.58 sea otters/km2 of habitat (i.e., the sub-tidal benthos between 0 m and 40 m depth) and current densities correspond on average to 50% of projected equilibrium values (range = 1–97%) with the earliest-colonized sub-regions tending to be closer to K. Assuming a similar range of equilibrium densities for currently un-occupied habitats, the projected value of K for all of Southeast Alaska is 74,650 sea otters. Future analyses can improve upon the precision of K estimates by employing more frequent surveys at index sites and incorporating environmental covariates into the process model to generate more accurate, location-specific estimates of equilibrium density. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

@article{Bowlby2020,
abstract = {Metapopulation structure is typically thought to increase regional species abundance, promote population persistence, and aid in the re-establishment of extirpated populations. However, the underlying theoretical models tended to assume high productivity, making the conservation benefit of metapopulation structure uncertain for endangered species with low productivity. We simulated population assemblages (N = 50) of diadromous fishes under high to low productivity scenarios to explicitly assess how straying (movement from natal to non-natal rivers) contributes to changes in species abundance and extinction risk. The population aggregation exhibited greater total abundance from source–sink dynamics and also exhibited the rescue effect when productivity remained moderately high. However, straying did not ensure persistence of nonviable populations or enable population re-establishment when productivity was low. These results were robust to a wide range of alternate spatial and life-history parameterizations of the simulation model. Relative to a real-world population aggregation of endangered Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), our results would argue for a shift in remediation priorities to prevent extinction. Although there is strong evolutionary justification for maintaining widespread distributions of endangered diadromous species, the immediate numerical consequences of this approach may hinder recovery.},
